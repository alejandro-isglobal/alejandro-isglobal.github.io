#### For questions **20-25)** consider the following:

You work at the meteorological office and have collected data relating to ozone levels in the atmosphere for each day from May to September (153 days). You want to determine which variables can predict ozone pollution levels to inform health agencies.

Here are the first six days of your data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(airquality)
airquality$"Day.week" <- rep(c("Wed", "Thr", "Fry", "Sat", "Sun", "Mon", "Tue"), 153)[1:153]
airquality$Ozone <- log(airquality$Ozone)
airquality$Alarm <- airquality$Ozone > 4
head(airquality)

```

Here is the illustration of the data in histograms and barplots

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.dim = c(8, 4)}

par(mfrow = c(2, 4))

hist(airquality$Ozone, main="Ozone levels", xlab="")
barplot(table(airquality$Alarm), main="Alarms for contamination",xlab="")
hist(airquality$Solar.R, main="Solar Radiation",xlab="")
hist(airquality$Wind, main="Wind",xlab="")
hist(airquality$Temp, main="Tamperature",xlab="")
barplot(table(airquality$Month), main="Month",xlab="")
barplot(table(airquality$Day.week), main="Day of the week",xlab="")

plot(0,type='n',axes=FALSE,ann=FALSE)
```

\newpage

**21)** If you want to know whether the mean ozone levels are different between spring (months: 5,6) and summer (months:7,8,9), what is the best hypothesis contrast? 

**$\qquad {\color{red}a}$:**

$\qquad H_0: \mu_{5\cap6}=\mu_{7\cap8\cap9}$

$\qquad H_1: \mu_{5\cap6}\neq\mu_{7\cap8\cap9}$

**b:**

$\qquad H_0: \mu_{5\cap6}\lt\mu_{7\cap8\cap9}$

$\qquad H_1: \mu_{5\cap6}\geq \mu_{7\cap8\cap9}$

**c:**

$\qquad H_0: \mu_{5}=\mu_{6}=\mu_{7}=\mu_{8}=\mu_{9}$

$\qquad H_1:$ At least one $\mu_i \neq 0$

**d:**

$\qquad H_0: p_{5\cap6}=p_{7\cap8\cap9}$

$\qquad H_1: p_{5\cap6}\neq p_{7\cap8\cap9}$

**22)** You hire a statistician who runs a group t-test of Ozone pollution between spring and summer and shows you the following results (x:spring, y:summer)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
spring <- airquality$Ozone[airquality$Month%in%c(5,6)]
summer <- airquality$Ozone[airquality$Month%in%c(7,8,9)]

t.test(spring, summer)

```

We say that a result is significant when we reject the null hypothesis. In the previous test you, therefore, conclude that 

**$\qquad$a:** The mean ozone levels in spring are significantly higher than the mean ozone levels in summer

**$\qquad {\color{red}b}$:** The mean ozone levels in summer are significantly higher than the mean ozone levels in spring 

**$\qquad$c:** The mean ozone levels in summer are not significantly higher than the mean ozone levels in spring 

**$\qquad$d:** The mean ozone levels in spring are not significantly higher than the mean ozone levels in summer 

\newpage

**23)** You tell your statistician that you are interested on the relationship between ozone levels and Temperature, therefore she runs a regression model of Ozone on Temperature, adjusted by Solar Radiation, Wind and Month. These are the results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(lm(Ozone ~ Temp + Solar.R + Wind + Month, data=airquality))
```

Why do you think that the statistician ran this test?

**$\qquad$a:** To show you the interaction between Temperature with other variables

**$\qquad$b:** To show you that Ozone depends on other variables in addition to Temperature

**$\qquad {\color{red}c}$:** To show you the statistical dependence between Ozone and Temperature adjusting by the effects of other variables 

**$\qquad$d:** To show you that Wind is more important predictor of Ozone than Temperature. 


**24)** We say that a result is significant when we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, in the previous analysis you can conclude that

**$\qquad$a:** Ozone decreases with Temperature but not significantly

**$\qquad$b:** Ozone increases with Temperature but not significantly

**$\qquad$c:**  Ozone significantly decreases with Temperature

**$\qquad {\color{red}d}$:** Ozone significantly increases with Temperature


**25)** You  are finally interested on testing whether the probability of sending an alarm of Ozone pollution depends on the day of the week. Therefore, the best way to test the statistical dependence between Alarms for for contamination and Day of the week is


**$\qquad$a:**  a two sample t-test

**$\qquad$b:**  an ANOVA

**$\qquad {\color{red}c}$:**  a Chi-squared test

**$\qquad$d:**  a 2-way ANOVA
