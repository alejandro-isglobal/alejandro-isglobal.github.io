\hypertarget{data-description}{%
\chapter{Data description}\label{data-description}}

In this chapter, we will introduce tools for describing data.

We will do so using tables, figures, and descriptive statistics of central tendency and dispersion.

We will also introduce key concepts in statistics such as randomized experiments, observations, outcomes, and absolute and relative frequencies.

\hypertarget{scientific-method}{%
\section{Scientific method}\label{scientific-method}}

One of the goals of the scientific method is to provide a framework for solving problems that arise in the study of natural phenomena or in the design of new technologies.

Modern humans have developed a \textbf{method} over thousands of years that is still in development.

The method has three main human activities:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Observation} characterized by the acquisition of \textbf{data}
\item
  \emph{Reason} characterized by the development of mathematical \textbf{models}
\item
  \emph{Action} characterized by the development of new \textbf{experiments} (technology)
\end{itemize}

Their complex interaction and results are the basis of \emph{scientific activity}.

\includegraphics{./figures/stats.JPG}

\hypertarget{statistics}{%
\section{Statistics}\label{statistics}}

Statistics deals with the interaction between \emph{models} and \emph{data} (the bottom part of the figure).

The statistical questions are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the best model for my data (inference)?
\item
  What are the data that a certain model (prediction) would produce?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

The data is presented in the form of observations.

An \textbf{Observation} or \textbf{Realization} is the acquisition of a number or characteristic of an experiment.

For example, let's take the series of numbers produced by repeating an experiment (1: success, 0: failure).

\ldots{} 1 0 0 1 0 \textbf{1} 0 1 1 \ldots{}

The number in bold is \textbf{an observation} in a repeat of the experiment

An \textbf{outcome} is a \textbf{possible} observation that is the result of an experiment.

\textbf{1} is one result, \textbf{0} is the other result of the experiment.

Remember that the observation is \textbf{concrete} is the number you get one day in the laboratory. The \textbf{abstract} result is one of the characteristics of the type of experiment you are running.

\hypertarget{result-types}{%
\section{Result types}\label{result-types}}

In statistics we are mainly interested in two types of results.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Categorical}: If the result of an experiment is a quality. They can be nominal (binary: yes, no; multiple: colors) or ordinal when the qualities can be ranked (severity of a disease).
\item
  \textbf{Numeric}: If the result of an experiment is a number. The number can be discrete (number of emails received in an hour, number of leukocytes in the blood) or continuous (battery charge status, engine temperature).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{random-experiments}{%
\section{Random experiments}\label{random-experiments}}

It can be said that the subject of study of statistics is random experiments, the means by which we produce data.

\textbf{Definition:}

A \textbf{random experiment} is an experiment that gives different results when repeated in the same way.

Randomized experiments are of different types, depending on how they are conducted:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  on the same object (person): temperature, sugar levels.
  different objects but of the same size: the weight of an animal.
\item
  about events: the number of hurricanes per year.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{absolute-frequencies}{%
\section{Absolute frequencies}\label{absolute-frequencies}}

When we repeat a randomized experiment with \textbf{categorical} results, we record a list of results.

We summarize observations by counting how many times we saw a particular result.

\textbf{Absolute frecuency}:

\[ n_i \]

is the number of times we observe the result \(i\).

\newpage

\textbf{Example (leukocytes)}

Let's take a leukocyte from \textbf{a} donor and write down its type. Let's repeat the experiment \(N=119\) times.

\begin{verbatim}
(T cell, T cell, Neutrophil, ..., B cell)
\end{verbatim}

The second \textbf{T cell} in bold is the second observation. The last \textbf{B cell} is observation number 119.

We can list the \textbf{results} (categories) in a \textbf{frequency table}:

\begin{verbatim}
##      outcome ni
## 1     T Cell 34
## 2     B cell 50
## 3   basophil 20
## 4   Monocyte  5
## 5 Neutrophil 10
\end{verbatim}

From the table, we can say that, for example, \(n_1=34\) is the total number of T cells observed in the repeat experiment. We also note that the total number of repetitions \(N=\sum_i n_i = 119\).

\hypertarget{relative-frequencies}{%
\section{Relative frequencies}\label{relative-frequencies}}

We can also summarize observations by calculating the \textbf{proportion} of how many times we saw a particular result.

\[ f_i = n_i /N\] where \(N\) is the total number of observations

In our example, \(n_1=34\) T cells were recorded, so we asked about the proportion of T cells out of the total \(119\). We can add these proportions \(f_i\) in the frequency table.

\begin{verbatim}
##      outcome ni         fi
## 1     T Cell 34 0.28571429
## 2     B cell 50 0.42016807
## 3   basophil 20 0.16806723
## 4   Monocyte  5 0.04201681
## 5 Neutrophil 10 0.08403361
\end{verbatim}

Relative frequencies are \textbf{fundamental} in statistics. They give the proportion of one result in relation to the other results. Later we will understand them as the observations of probabilities.

For absolute and relative frequencies we have the properties

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\sum_{i=1..M} n_i = N\)
\item
  \(\sum_{i=1..M} f_i = 1\)
\end{itemize}

where \(M\) is the number of results.

\hypertarget{bar-chart}{%
\section{Bar chart}\label{bar-chart}}

When we have a lot of results and want to see which ones are most likely, we can use a bar chart that is a number of \(n_i\) Vs the results.

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{pie-chart-pie}{%
\section{Pie chart (pie)}\label{pie-chart-pie}}

We can also visualize the relative frequencies with a pie chart.

The area of the circle represents 100\% of the observations (proportion = 1) and the sections the relative frequencies of each result.

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{ordinal-categorical-variables}{%
\section{Ordinal categorical variables}\label{ordinal-categorical-variables}}

The leukocyte type in the above examples is a \textbf{categorical} nominal variable. Each observation belongs to a category (quality). The categories do not always have a certain order .

Sometimes \textbf{categorical} variables can be \textbf{sorted} when they meet a natural ranking. This allows you to compute \textbf{cumulative frequencies}.

\newpage

\textbf{Example (Misophonia)}

This is a clinical study on 123 patients who were examined for their degree of misophonia. Misophnia is uncontrolled anxiety/anger produced by certain sounds .

Each patient was evaluated with a questionnaire (AMISO) and they were classified into 4 different groups according to severity.

The results of the study are

\begin{verbatim}
##   [1] 4 2 0 3 0 0 2 3 0 3 0 2 2 0 2 0 0 3 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 4 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 2
##  [38] 3 2 2 0 2 3 0 0 2 2 3 3 0 0 4 3 3 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 1 3 2 4 3 2 3
##  [75] 0 2 3 2 4 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 4 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 2 1 3 0 0 3 2 1 3 0 4 4 2 3 3
## [112] 3 0 3 2 1 2 3 3 4 2 3 2
\end{verbatim}

Each observation is the result of a randomized experiment: measurement of the level of misophonia in a patient. This data series can be summarized in terms of the results in the frequency table

\begin{verbatim}
##   outcome ni         fi
## 1       0 41 0.33333333
## 2       1  5 0.04065041
## 3       2 37 0.30081301
## 4       3 31 0.25203252
## 5       4  9 0.07317073
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{accumulated-absolute-and-relative-frequencies}{%
\section{Accumulated absolute and relative frequencies}\label{accumulated-absolute-and-relative-frequencies}}

Misophonia severity is \textbf{categorical} \textbf{ordinal} because its results can be ordered relative to its degree.

When the results can be ordered, it is useful to ask how many observations were obtained up to a given result. We call this number the \textbf{absolute cumulative frequency} up to the result \(i\):
\[N_i =\sum_{k= 1..i } n_k\]
It is also useful for calculating the \textbf{proportion} of observations up to a given result.

\[F_i =\sum_{k= 1..i } f_k\]

We can add these frequencies in the \textbf{frequency table}

\begin{verbatim}
##   outcome ni         fi  Ni        Fi
## 0       0 41 0.33333333  41 0.3333333
## 1       1  5 0.04065041  46 0.3739837
## 2       2 37 0.30081301  83 0.6747967
## 3       3 31 0.25203252 114 0.9268293
## 4       4  9 0.07317073 123 1.0000000
\end{verbatim}

Therefore, \textbf{67\%} of patients had misophonia up to severity \textbf{2} and \textbf{37\%} of patients had severity less than or equal to \textbf{1}.

\hypertarget{cumulative-frequency-graph}{%
\section{Cumulative frequency graph}\label{cumulative-frequency-graph}}

\(F_i\) is an important quantity because it allows us to define the accumulation of probabilities down to intermediate levels.

The probability of an intermediate level \(x\) (\(i\leq x< i+1\)) is just the accumulation up to the lower level \(F_x = F_i\).

\(F_x\) is therefore a function on a \textbf{continuous} range of values. We can draw it with respect to the results.

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

Therefore, we can say that \textbf{67\%} of the patients had misophonia up to severity \(2.3\), although \(2.3\) is not an observed outcome.

\hypertarget{numeric-variables}{%
\section{Numeric variables}\label{numeric-variables}}

The result of a random experiment can produce a number. If the number is \textbf{discrete}, we can generate a frequency table, with absolute, relative, and cumulative frequencies, and illustrate them with bar, pie, and cumulative charts.

When the number is \textbf{continuous} the frequencies are not useful, we are most likely to observe or not observe a particular continuous number.

\textbf{Example (misophonia)}

The researchers wondered if the convexity of the jaw would affect the severity of misophonia. The scientific hypothesis is that the angle of convexity of the jaw can influence hearing and its sensitivity. These are the mandibular convexity results (degrees) for each patient:

Therefore, instead of saying that the first patient had an angle of convexity of \(7.97\), we say that his angle was between the interval (or \textbf{bin}) \((7.92,12.4]\).

No other patients had an angle of \(7.97\), but many had angles between \((7.92,12.4]\).

\hypertarget{histogram}{%
\section{Histogram}\label{histogram}}

The histogram is the graph of \(n_i\) or \(f_i\) Vs the results in intervals (bins). The histogram depends on the size of the bins .

\newpage

This is a histogram with 20 bins .

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-14-1.pdf}

We see that most people have angles within \((7, 8]\)

\hypertarget{cumulative-frequency-graph-1}{%
\section{Cumulative frequency graph}\label{cumulative-frequency-graph-1}}

We can also plot \(F_x\) against the results. Since \(F_x\) is of continuous range, we can order the observations (\(x_1 <... x_j < x_{j+1} < x_n\)) and therefore

\[F_x = \frac{k}{ n}\]

for \(x_{k} \leq x < x_{k+ 1}\) .

\(F_x\) is known as the \textbf{distribution} of the data. \(F_x\) does not depend on the size of the bin. However, its \textbf{resolution} depends on the amount of data.

\hypertarget{summary-statistics}{%
\section{Summary Statistics}\label{summary-statistics}}

Summary statistics are numbers calculated from the data that tell us important characteristics of the numerical variables (discrete or continuous).

For example, we have statistics that describe extreme values:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{minimum}: the minimum result observed
\item
  \textbf{maximum}: the maximum result observed
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{average-sample-mean}{%
\section{Average (sample mean)}\label{average-sample-mean}}

An important statistic that describes the central value of the results (where to expect most observations) is the \textbf{average}

\[\bar{x}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j= 1..N } x_j \]

where \(x_j\) is the \textbf{observation} \(j\) out of a total of \(N\).

\textbf{Example (Misophonia)}

The average convexity can be calculated directly from the \textbf{observations} in the usual way

\(\bar{x}= \frac{1}{ N}\sum_j x_j\)

\(= \frac{1}{ N}( 7.97 + 18.23 + 12.27... + 6.80) = 10.19894\)

For \textbf{categorically ordered} variables, we can \textbf{also} use the relative frequencies to calculate the average

\(\bar{x}=\frac{1}{ N}\sum_{i=1...N} x_j =\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1...M} x_i n_ {i}=\)
\[\sum_{i=1...M} x_i f_{i}\]

where we went from adding \(N\) \textbf{observations} to adding \(M\) \textbf{results}.

The form \(\bar{x}= \sum_{i = 1...M} x_i f_i\) shows that the average is the \textbf{center of gravity} of the results. As if each result had a mass density given by \(f_i\).

\textbf{Example (Misophonia)}

The average \textbf{severity} of misophonia in the study can be calculated from the relative frequencies of the \textbf{outcomes}

\begin{verbatim}
##   outcome ni         fi
## 1       0 41 0.33333333
## 2       1  5 0.04065041
## 3       2 37 0.30081301
## 4       3 31 0.25203252
## 5       4  9 0.07317073
\end{verbatim}

\(\bar{x}=0*f_ {0}+ 1*f_{1}+2*f_{2}+3*f_{3}+4*f_{4}=1.691057\)

The average is also the center of gravity for continuous variables. That is the point where the relative frequencies balance.

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-17-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{median}{%
\section{Median}\label{median}}

Another measure of centrality is the median. The median \(x_m\), or \(q_{0.5}\), is the value below which we find half of the observations. When we order the observations \(x_1 <... x_j < x_{j+1} < x_N\), we count them until we find half of them. Therefore, \(x_m\) is the observation such that \(m\) satisfies

\[\sum_{i\leq m} 1 = \frac{N}{2}\]
\textbf{Example (Misophonia)}

If we order the angles of convexity, we see that \(62\) observations (individuals) (\(N/2 \sim 123/2\)) are below \(7.96\). The \textbf{median convexity} is therefore \(q_{0.5}= x_{62}=7.96\)

In terms of frequencies, \(q_{0.5}\) makes the cumulative frequency \(F_x\) equal to \(0.5\)

\[\sum_{i = 0, ... m} f_i =F_{q_{0.5}}=0.5\]
that is

\[q_{ 0.5}= F^{-1}(0.5)\]

This last equation means that, in the distribution graph, the median \(q_{ 0.5}\) is the value of \(x\) at which we have climbed half of the total height of \(F\).

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{dispersion}{%
\section{Dispersion}\label{dispersion}}

Other important summary statistics for observations are the \textbf{spread} statistics.

Many experiments may share their mean, but differ in how \textbf{sparse} the values are.

The dispersion of the observations is a measure of the \textbf{noise}.

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf} \includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-23-2.pdf}

\hypertarget{sample-variance}{%
\section{Sample variance}\label{sample-variance}}

The dispersion about the mean is measured by the sample variance

\[s^2=\frac{ 1}{ N-1} \sum_{j=1..N} ( x_j -\bar{x})^2\]

This number measures the average squared distance of the \textbf{observations} from the average. The reason for \(N-1\) will be explained when we talk about inference, when we study the spread of \(\bar{x}\), as well as the spread of the observations.

In terms of the frequencies of the variables that are \textbf{categorical and ordered}, we can \textbf{also} calculate the sample variance as

\[s^2=\frac{N}{N-1} \sum_{i=1... M} (x_i -\bar{x})^2 f_i\]

\(s^2\) can be considered as the \textbf{moment of inertia} of the observations.

The square root of the sample variance, \(s\), is called \textbf{standard deviation} of the sample.

\textbf{Example (Misophonia)}

The standard deviation of the angle of convexity is

\(s= [\frac{ 1}{123-1}((7.97-10.19894)^2+ (18.23-10.19894)^2\)
\[+ (12.27-10.19894 )^ 2 + ...)]^{1/2} = 5.086707\]

The jaw convexity deviates from its mean by \(5.086707\).

\hypertarget{interquartile-range-iqr}{%
\section{Interquartile range (IQR)}\label{interquartile-range-iqr}}

The spread of the data can also be measured with respect to the median using the \textbf{interquartile range}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  We define the \textbf{first} quartile as the value \(x_m\) that makes the cumulative frequency \(F_{q_{0.25}}\) equal to \(0.25\) (or the value of \(x\) where we have accumulated a quarter of the observations, or the value that splits the first quarter of the observations)
\end{enumerate}

\[q_{0.25}=F^{-1}(0.25)\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  We define the \textbf{third} quartile as the value \(x_m\) that makes the cumulative frequency \(F_{q_{0.75}}\) equal to \(0.75\) (or the value of \(x\) where we have accumulated three quarters of observations)
\end{enumerate}

\[q_{0.75}=F^{-1}(0.75)\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{interquartile range} (IQR) is \[IQR=q_{0.75} - q_{0.25}\]
\end{enumerate}

This is the distance between the third and first quartiles and captures the central \(50\%\) of the observations

\hypertarget{boxplot}{%

The interquartile range, median, and \(5\%\) and \(95\%\) of the data can be displayed in a \textbf{box plot}.

In the boxplot, the values of the results are on the y-axis. The IQR is the box, the median is the middle line, and the whiskers mark the \(5\%\) and \(95\%\) of the data.

Then the relative frequency for the outcome \(3\) is

\textbf{\(\qquad\)a :} We can \textbf{only} make a nationality pie chart because it has more than two possible outcomes;

\textbf{\(\qquad\)b :} We can make a pie graph for a new variable marking gender \textbf{and} nationality;

\textbf{\(\qquad\)c :} We can make a pie chart for the variable sex \textbf{or} the variable nationality;

In this chapter we will introduce the concept of probability from relative frequencies.

Then we will discuss the concept of conditional probability derived from the joint probability of two events.

\hypertarget{random-experiments-1}{%
\section{Random experiments}\label{random-experiments-1}}

Let's remember the basic objective of statistics. Statistics deals with data that is presented in the form of observations.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An \textbf{observation} is the acquisition of a number or characteristic from an experiment
\end{itemize}

Observations are realizations of \textbf{results}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An \textbf{outcome} is a possible observation that is the result of an experiment.
\end{itemize}

When conducting experiments, we often get different results. The description of the variability of the results is one of the objectives of statistics.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \textbf{random experiment} is an experiment that gives different results when repeated in the same way.
\end{itemize}

The philosophical question behind it is how can we know something if every time we look at it it changes?

\hypertarget{measurement-probability}{%
\section{Measurement probability}\label{measurement-probability}}

We would like to have a measure for the outcome of a randomized experiment that tells us \textbf{how sure} we are of observing the outcome when we perform a \textbf{future} randomized experiment.

We will call this measure the probability of the outcome and assign values to it:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  0, when we are sure that the observation will \textbf{not} occur.
\item
  1, when we are sure that the observation will happen.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{classical-probability}{%
\section{Classical probability}\label{classical-probability}}

\textbf{As long as} a random experiment has \(M\) possible outcomes that are all \textbf{equally likely}, the probability of each \(i\) outcome is \[P_i =\frac{1}{ M}\].

Classical probability was defended by Laplace (1814).

Since every outcome is \textbf{equally likely} in this type of experiment, we declare complete ignorance and the best we can do is equally distribute the same probability for each outcome.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We do not observe \(P_i\)
\item
  We deduce \(P_i\) from our ratio and we don't need to carry out any experiment to know it.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example (dice):}

What is the probability that we will get \(2\) on the roll of a die?

\(P_2=1/6=0.166666\).

\hypertarget{relative-frequencies-1}{%
\section{Relative frequencies}\label{relative-frequencies-1}}

What about random experiments whose possible outcomes are \textbf{not} equally likely?

How then can we define the probabilities of the outcomes?

\textbf{Example (random experiment)}

Imagine that we repeat a random experiment \(8\) times and obtain the following observations

8 4 12 7 10 7 9 12

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How sure are we of obtaining the result \(12\) in the following observation?
\end{itemize}

The frequency table is

\begin{verbatim}
##   outcome ni    fi
## 1       4  1 0.125
## 2       7  2 0.250
## 3       8  1 0.125
## 4       9  1 0.125
## 5      10  1 0.125
## 6      12  2 0.250
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-29-1.pdf}

The \textbf{relative frequency} \(f_i =\frac{ n_ i }{ N}\) seems like a reasonable probability measure because

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  is a number between \(0\) and \(1\).
\item
  measures the proportion of the total number of observations that we observe of a particular result.
\end{itemize}

Since \(f_{12}=0.25\) then we would be one quarter sure, one out of every 4 observations, of getting \(12\).

\textbf{Question}: How good is \(f_i\) as a measure of certainty of the result \(i\)?

\textbf{Example (random experiment with more repetitions)}

Let's say we repeat the experiment 100,000 more times:

The frequency table is now

\begin{verbatim}
##    outcome    ni      fi
## 1        2  2807 0.02807
## 2        3  5607 0.05607
## 3        4  8435 0.08435
## 4        5 11070 0.11070
## 5        6 13940 0.13940
## 6        7 16613 0.16613
## 7        8 13806 0.13806
## 8        9 10962 0.10962
## 9       10  8402 0.08402
## 10      11  5581 0.05581
## 11      12  2777 0.02777
\end{verbatim}

and the barplot is

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-31-1.pdf}

New results came out and \(f_{12}\) is now only \(0.027\), and so we are only \(\sim 3\%\) sure to get \(12\) in the next experiment. The probabilities measured by \(f_i\) change with \(N\).

\hypertarget{relative-frequencies-at-infinity}{%
\section{Relative frequencies at infinity}\label{relative-frequencies-at-infinity}}

A crucial observation is that if we measure the probabilities of \(f_i\) in increasing values of \(N\) they \textbf{converge}!

In this graph each vertical section gives the relative frequency of each observation. We see that after \(N=1000\) (\(log10(N)=3\)) the proportions hardly change with more \(N\).

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-32-1.pdf}

We find that each of the relative frequencies \(f_i\) converges to a constant value

\[lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} f_i = P_i\]

\hypertarget{frequentist-probability}{%
\section{Frequentist probability}\label{frequentist-probability}}

We call \textbf{Probability} \(P_i\) the limit as \(N \rightarrow \infty\) of the \textbf{relative frequency} of observing the outcome \(i\) in a random experiment.

Defended by Venn (1876), the frequentist definition of probability is derived from (empirical) data/experience.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We do not observe \(P_i\), we observe \(f_i\)
\item
  \textbf{We estimate} \(P_i\) with \(f_i\) (usually when \(N\) is large), we write: \[\hat {P_ i}= f_i\]
\end{itemize}

Similar to the relationship between \textbf{observation} and \textbf{result}, we have the relationship between \textbf{relative frequency} and \textbf{probability} as a concrete value of an abstract quantity.

\hypertarget{classical-and-frequentist-probabilities}{%
\section{Classical and frequentist probabilities}\label{classical-and-frequentist-probabilities}}

We have situations where classical probability can be used to find the limit of relative frequencies:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the results are \textbf{equally probable}, the classical probability gives us the limit:
\end{itemize}

\[P_i=lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} \frac{n_i}{N}=\frac{1}{M}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the results in which we are interested can be derived from other \textbf{equally probable} results. We will see more about this when we study probability models.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example (sum of two dice)}

Our previous example is based on the \textbf{sum of two dice}.
Although we perform the experiment many times, write down the results, and calculate the \textbf{relative frequencies}, we can know the exact value of probability.

This probability \textbf{follows} from the fact that the outcome of each die is \textbf{equally likely}. From this assumption, we can find that (Exercise 1)

\[
    P_i =
\begin{cases}
\frac{i-1}{36},& i \in \{2,3,4,5,6, 7\} \\
\frac{13-i}{36},& i \in \{8,9,10,11,12\} \\
\end{cases}
\]

The motivation of the frequentist definition is \textbf{empirical} (data) while that of the classical definition is \textbf{rational} (models). We often combine both approaches (inference and deduction) to find out the probabilities of our random experiment.

\includegraphics{./figures/prob.JPG}

\hypertarget{definition-of-probability}{%
\section{Definition of probability}\label{definition-of-probability}}

A probability is a number that is assigned to each possible outcome of a random experiment and satisfies the following properties or \textbf{axioms}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  when the results \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are mutually exclusive; that is, only one of them can occur, so the probability of observing \(E_1\) \textbf{or} \(E_1\), written as \(E_1\cup E_2\), is their sum:
  \[ P( E_1\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2)\]
\item
  when \(S\) is the set of all possible outcomes, then its probability is \(1\) (at least something is observed): \[P(S)=1\]
\item
  The probability of any outcome is between 0 and 1 \[P(E) \in [0,1]\]
\end{enumerate}

Proposed by Kolmogorov's less than 100 years ago (1933)

\hypertarget{probabilities-table}{%
\section{Probabilities Table}\label{probabilities-table}}

Kolmogorov properties are the basic rules for building a \textbf{probability table}, similar to the relative frequency table.

\textbf{Example (dice)}

The probability table for the throw of a dice

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
result & probability \\
\midrule
\endhead
\(1\) & 1/6 \\
\(2\) & 1/6 \\
\(3\) & 1/6 \\
\(4\) & 1/6 \\
\(5\) & 1/6 \\
\(6\) & 1/6 \\
\(P( 1 \cup 2\cup ... \cup 6)\) & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Let's verify the axioms:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Where \(1 \cup 2\) is, for example, the \textbf{event} of rolling a \(1\) \textbf{or} a \(2\). So \[ P( 1 \cup 2)=P(1)+P(2)=2/6\]
\item
  Since \(S= \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6\}\) is made up of \textbf{mutually exclusive} outcomes, then
\end{enumerate}

\[P(S)=P(1\cup 2\cup ... \cup 6) = P(1)+P(2)+ ...+P(n)=1\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  The probabilities of each outcome are between \(0\) and \(1\).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sample-space}{%
\section{Sample space}\label{sample-space}}

The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the \textbf{sample space} and is denoted \(S\).

The sample space can be made up of categorical or numerical outcomes.

\emph{For example:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  human temperature: \(S = (36, 42)\) degrees Celsius.
\item
  sugar levels in humans: \(S =( 70-80) mg/ dL\)
\item
  the size of a production line screw: \(S =( 70-72) mm\)
\item
  number of emails received in an hour: \(S = \{ 1, ...\infty \}\)
\item
  the throw of a dice: \(S= \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{events}{%
\section{Events}\label{events}}

An \textbf{event} \(A\) is a \textbf{subset} of the sample space. It is a \textbf{collection} of posible results.

\emph{Examples of events:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The event of a healthy temperature: \(A=37-38\) degrees Celsius
\item
  The event of producing a screw with a size: \(A=71.5mm\)
\item
  The event of receiving more than 4 emails in an hour: \(A= \{ 4, \infty \}\)
\item
  The event of obtaining a number less than or equal to 3 in the roll of a says: \(A= \{ 1,2,3\}\)
\end{itemize}

An event refers to a possible set of \textbf{outcomes}.

\hypertarget{algebra-of-events}{%
\section{Algebra of events}\label{algebra-of-events}}

For two events \(A\) and \(B\), we can construct the following derived events using the basic set operations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Complement \(A'\): the event of \textbf{not} \(A\)
\item
  Union \(A \cup B\): the event of \(A\) \textbf{or} \(B\)
\item
  Intersection \(A \ cap B\): the event of \(A\) \textbf{and} \(B\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example (dice)}

Let's roll a die and look at the events (result set):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a number less than or equal to three \(A:\{ 1,2,3\}\)
\item
  an even number \(B:\{ 2,4,6\}\)
\end{itemize}

Let's see how we can build new events with set operations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a number not less than three: \(A ':\{4,5,6\}\)
\item
  a number less than or equal to three \textbf{or} even: \(A \cup B: \{ 1,2,3,4,6\}\)
\item
  a number less than or equal to three \textbf{and} even \(A \cap B: \{ 2\}\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mutually-exclusive-results}{%
\section{Mutually exclusive results}\label{mutually-exclusive-results}}

Outcomes like rolling \(1\) and \(2\) on a die are events that cannot occur at the same time. We say that they are \textbf{mutually exclusive}.

In general, two events denoted as \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are mutually exclusive when

\[E_1\cap E_2=\emptyset\]

\emph{Examples:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The result of having a misophonia severity of \(1\) and a severity of \(4\).
\item
  The results of obtaining \(12\) and \(5\) by adding the throw of two dice.
\end{itemize}

According to the Kolmogorov properties , only \textbf{mutually exclusive} outcomes can be arranged in \textbf{probability tables}, as in relative frequency tables.

\hypertarget{joint-probabilities}{%
\section{Joint probabilities}\label{joint-probabilities}}

The \textbf{joint probability} of \(A\) and \(B\) is the probability of \(A\) and \(B\). That's \[P( A \cap B)\] or \(P(A,B)\).

To write joint probabilities of non mutually exclusive events (\(A \cap B \neq \emptyset\)) into a probability table, we note that we can always decompose the sample space into \textbf{mutually exclusive} sets involving the intersections:

\(S=\{A\cap B, A \cap B', A'\cap B, A'\cap B'\}\)

\textbf{Let's consider the Ven diagram} for the example where \(A\) is the event that corresponds to drawing a number less than or equal to 3 and \(B\) corresponds to an even number:

\includegraphics{./figures/Venn.JPG}

The \textbf{marginals} of \(A\) and \(B\) are the probability of \(A\) and the probability of \(B\), respectively:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(A)=P(A\cap B') + P(A \cap B)=2/6+1/6=3/6\)
\item
  \(P(B)=P(A'\cap B) +P(A \cap B)=2/6+1/6=3/6\)
\end{itemize}

We can now write the \textbf{probability table} for the joint probabilities

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
Result & probability \\
\midrule
\endhead
\((A\cap B)\) & \(P(A \cap B)=1/6\) \\
\((A\cap B')\) & \(P(A \cap B')=2/6\) \\
\((A'\cap B)\) & \(P(A' \cap B)=2/6\) \\
\((A'\cap B')\) & \(P(A' \cap B')=1/6\) \\
sum & \(1\) \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Each result has \(two\) values (one for the feature of type \(A\) and one for type \(B\))

\hypertarget{contingency-table}{%
\section{Contingency table}\label{contingency-table}}

The joint probability table can also be written in a \textbf{contingency table}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
& \(B\) & \(B'\) & sum \\
\midrule
\endhead
\(A\) & \(P(A \cap B )\) & \(P(A\cap B' )\) & \(P(A)\) \\
\(A'\) & \(P(A'\cap B )\) & \(P(A'\cap B' )\) & \(P(A')\) \\
sum & \(P(B)\) & \(P(B')\) & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Where the marginals are the sums in the margins of the table, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(A)=P(A \cap B') + P(A \cap B)\)
\item
  \(P(B)=P(A' \cap B) +P(A \cap B)\)
\end{itemize}

In our example, the contingency table is

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
& \(B\) & \(B'\) & sum \\
\midrule
\endhead
\(A\) & \(1/6\) & \(2/6\) & \(3/6\) \\
\(A'\) & \(2/6\) & \(1/6\) & \(3/6\) \\
sum & \(3/6\) & \(3/6\) & \(1\) \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{the-addition-rule}{%
\section{The addition rule:}\label{the-addition-rule}}

The addition rule allows us to calculate the probability of \(A\) or \(B\), \(P( A \cup B)\), in terms of the probability of \(A\) and \(B\), \(P(A \cup B )\). We can do this in three equivalent ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Using the marginals and the joint probability
  \[P(A \cup B)=P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)\]
\item
  Using only joint probabilities
  \[P( A \cup B)=P(A \cap B)+P(A\cap B')+P(A'\cap B)\]
\item
  Using the complement of joint probability
  \[P(A \cup B)=1-P(A'\cap B')\]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example (dice)}

Take the events \(A:\{ 1,2,3\}\), rolling a number less than or equal to \(3\), and \(B:\{2,4,6\}\), rolling an even number on the roll of a dice.

Therefore:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  \(P( A \cup B)=P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)=3/6+3/6-1/6=5/6\)
\item
  \(P(A \cup B)=P(A \cap B)+P(A\cap B')+P(A'\cap B)=1/6+2/6+2/6=5/6\)
\item
  \(P(A \cup B)=1-P(A'\cap B')= 1-1/6=5/6\)
\end{enumerate}

In the contingency table \(P( A \cup B)\) corresponds to the cells in bold (method 2 above). That is all cells but 1/6 from the bottom right (method 3).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
& \(B\) & \(B'\) \\
\midrule
\endhead
\(A\) & \textbf{1/6} & \textbf{2/6} \\
\(A'\) & \textbf{2/6} & \emph{1/6} \\

In this chapter, we will introduce conditional probability.

We will use conditional probability to define statistical independence.

We will discuss Bayes' theorem and we will discuss one of its main applications, which is the predictive efficiency of a diagnostic tool.

\hypertarget{joint-probability}{%
\section{Joint probability}\label{joint-probability}}

Recall that the joint probability of two events \(A\) and \(B\) is defined as their intersection

\[P( A ,B )=P(A \cap B)\]

Now imagine randomized experiments that measure two different types of outcomes.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  height and weight of an individual: \((h, w)\)
\item
  time and position of an electric charge: \((p, t)\)
\item
  the throw of two dice: (\(n_1\), \(n_2\))
\item
  cross two green traffic lights: (\(\bar{ R_ 1}\) , \(\bar{R_2}\))
\end{itemize}

We are often interested in whether the values of one result \textbf{condition} the values of the other.

\hypertarget{statistical-independence}{%
\section{Statistical independence}\label{statistical-independence}}

In many cases, we are interested in whether two events often tend to occur together. We want to be able to discern between two cases.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence} between events. For example, rolling a 1 on one die does not make it more likely to roll another 1 on a second die.
\item
  \textbf{Correlation} between events. For example, if a man is tall, he is probably heavy.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example (conductor)}

We conducted an experiment to find out if observing structural flaws in a material affects its conductivity.

The data would look like

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
Conductor & Structure & conductivity \\
\midrule
\endhead
\(c_1\) & flaws & low \\
\(c_2\) & no flaws & high \\
\(c_3\) & flaws & low \\
\ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} \\
\(c_i\) & no flaws & low* \\
\ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} \\
\ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} \\
\(c_n\) & flaws & high* \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

We can expect low conductivity to occur more often with flaws than without flaws if the flaws affect conductivity.

Let's imagine that from the data we obtain the following contingency table of \textbf{estimated joint probabilities}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
& with flaws (F) & no flaws (F') & sum \\
\midrule
\endhead
low (L) & \(0.005\) & \(0.045\) & \(0.05\) \\
high (L') & \(0.095\) & \(0.855\) & \(0.95\) \\
sum & \(0.1\) & \(0.9\) & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

where, for example, the joint probability of \(L\) and \(F\) is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(L,F )=0.005\)
\end{itemize}

and the marginal probabilities are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(L)=P(L, F) + P(L, F')=0.05\)
\item
  \(P(F)=P(L, F) + P(L', F)= 0.1\).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-conditional-probability}{%
\section{The conditional probability}\label{the-conditional-probability}}

Low conductivity is \textbf{independent} of having structural flaws if the probability of having low conductivity (\(L\)) is the same \textbf{whether} it has flaws (\(F\)) or not (\(F'\) ) .

Let us first consider only the materials that have flaws.

Among those materials that have flaws (\(F\)), what is the estimated probability that they have low conductivity?

\(\hat{P}(L| F)= \frac{n_{L,F}}{n_{F}}=\frac{n_{L,F}/n}{n_{F}/n}= \frac{f_{L,F}}{f_{F}}\)
\[= \frac{\hat{P}( L,F )}{\hat{P}(F)}\]
Therefore, in the limit when \(N \rightarrow \infty\), we have

\[P(L| F)= \frac{P(L,F)}{P(D)}=\frac{P(L\cap F)}{P(D)}\]
\textbf{Definition:}

The \emph{conditional probability} of an event \(B\) given an event \(A\), denoted \(P(A| B)\) , is

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\]

We can prove that conditional probability satisfies the axioms of probability. The conditional probability can be understood as a probability with a sample space given by \(B\): \(S_B\). In our example, the materials with stuctural flaw.

\hypertarget{conditional-contingency-table}{%
\section{Conditional contingency table}\label{conditional-contingency-table}}

If we divide the columns of the joint probability table by the marginal probabilities of the conditioning effects (\(F\) and \(F'\)), we can write \textbf{a conditional contingency table}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
& F & F' \\
\midrule
\endhead
L & P( L {\textbar{}} F) & P(L {\textbar{}} F') \\
L' & P(L' {\textbar{}} F) & P(L' {\textbar{}} F') \\
sum & 1 & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

where the column probabilities sum to one. The first column shows the probabilities of low conductivity or not only of the materials that have flaws (first condition: \(F\)). The second column shows the probabilities only for the materials that have no flaws (second condition: \(F'\)).

Conditional probabilities are the probabilities of the event within each condition. We read them as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(L| F)\): Probability of having low conductivity \textbf{if} it has flaws
\item
  \(P(L'| F)\): Probability of not having low conductivity \textbf{if} it has flaws
\item
  \(P(L|F ')\): Probability of having low conductivity \textbf{if} it has no flaws
\item
  \(P(L'|F ')\): Probability of not having low conductivity \textbf{if} it has no flaws
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{statistical-independence-1}{%
\section{Statistical independence}\label{statistical-independence-1}}

In our example, the conditional contingency table is

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
& F & F' \\
\midrule
\endhead
L & P(L{\textbar{}}F) = 0.05 & P(L{\textbar{}}F')= 0.05 \\
L' & P(L'{\textbar{}}F)=0.95 & P(L'{\textbar{}}F')=0.95 \\
sum & 1 & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

We note that the marginal and conditional probabilities are the same!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(L| F)= P(L|F')=P(L)\)
\item
  \(P(L'| F)= P(L'|F')=P(L')\)
\end{itemize}

This means that the probability of observing a low conductivity is \textbf{not} dependent on having a structural flaw or not.

We conclude that low conductivity is not affected by having a structural flaw.

\textbf{Definition}

Two events \(A\) and \(B\) are statistically independent if either of the equivalent cases occurs.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(A| B)= P(A)\); \(A\) is independent of \(B\)
\item
  \(P(B| A)= P(B)\); \(B\) is independent of \(A\)
\end{enumerate}

and by the definition of conditional probability

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)=P(A)P(B)\)
\end{enumerate}

This third form is a statement about joint probabilities. It says that we can obtain joint probabilities by multiplying the marginal ones.

In our original joint probability table

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
& F & F' & sum \\
\midrule
\endhead
L & \(0.005\) & \(0.045\) & \(0.05\) \\
L' & \(0.095\) & \(0.855\) & \(0.95\) \\
sum & \(0.1\) & \(0.9\) & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

we can confirm that all the entries of the matrix are the product of the marginal ones. For example: \(P(F)P(L)= P( L \cap F)\) and \(P(L')P(F')=P(L' \cap F')\). Therefore, low conductivity is independent of having a structural flaw.

\textbf{Example (Coins)}

We want to confirm that the results of tossing two coins are independent. We consider all outcomes to be equally likely:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
result & probability \\
\midrule
\endhead
\(( H,T )\) & 1/4 \\
\(( H,H )\) & 1/4 \\
\(( T,T )\) & 1/4 \\
\(( T, H )\) & 1/4 \\
sum & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

where \(( H,T )\) is, for example, the event of heads on the first coin and tails on the second coin. The contingency table for the joint probabilities is:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
& H & T & sum \\
\midrule
\endhead
H & \(1/4\) & \(1/4\) & \(1/2\) \\
T & \(1/4\) & \(1/4\) & \(1/2\) \\
sum & \(1/2\) & \(1/2\) & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

From this table, we see that the probability of getting a head and then a tail is the product of the marginals \(P( H, T)=P(H)*P(T)=1/4\). Therefore, the events of heads in the first coin and tails in the second are independent.

If we build the conditional contingency table on the toss of the first coin, we will see that obtaining tails in the second coin is not conditioned by having obtained heads in the first coin: \(P(T| H)= P(T) =1 / 2\)

\hypertarget{statistical-dependency}{%
\section{Statistical dependency}\label{statistical-dependency}}

An important example of statistical dependency is found in the performance of \textbf{diagnostic tools}, where we want to determine the state of a system(s) with results

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  satisfactory (yes)
\item
  unsatisfactory (not)
\end{itemize}

with a test (t) with results

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  positive
\item
  negative
\end{itemize}

For example, we test a battery to see how long it can last. We load a cable to find out if it resists carrying a certain load. We run a PCR to see if someone is infected.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-test}{%
\section{Diagnostic test}\label{diagnostic-test}}

Let's consider diagnosing an infection with a new test. Infection status:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  yes (infected)
\item
  no (not infected)
\end{itemize}

Test:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  positive
\item
  negative
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{conditional contingency table} is what we get in a controlled environment (laboratory)

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
& Infection: yes & Infection: No \\
\midrule
\endhead
Test: positive & P(positive {\textbar{}} yes) & P(positive {\textbar{}} no) \\
Test: negative & P(negative {\textbar{}} yes) & P(negative {\textbar{}} no) \\
sum & 1 & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Let's look at the table entries
1) Rate of true positives (Sensitivity): The probability of testing positive \textbf{if} you have the disease \(P(positive| yes)\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Rate of true negatives (Specificity): The probability of testing negative \textbf{if} you do not have the disease \(P(negative| no)\)
\item
  False positive rate: the probability of testing positive \textbf{if} you do not have the disease \(P(positive| no)\)
\item
  False negative rate: the probability of testing negative \textbf{if} you have the disease \(P(negative| yes)\)
\end{enumerate}

High correlation (statistical dependence) between test and infection means high values for probabilities 1 and 2 \textbf{and} low values for probabilities 3 and 4.

\textbf{Example (COVID)}

Now let's consider a real situation. In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, there was no measure of the effectiveness of PCRs in detecting the virus. One of the first published studies (\url{https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2015897}) found that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The PCR had a sensitivity of 70\%, in infection condition.
\item
  The PCR had a specificity of 94\%, in non-infected condition.
\end{itemize}

The conditional contingency table is

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
& Infection: yes & Infection: No \\
\midrule
\endhead
Test: positive & P(positive{\textbar{}} yes)= 0.7 & P(positive{\textbar{}}no)=0.06 \\
Test: negative & P(negative{\textbar{}} yes)= 0.3 & P(negative{\textbar{}}no)=0.94 \\
sum & 1 & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Therefore, the errors in the diagnostic tests were:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The false positive rate is \(P(positive| no)= 0.06\)
\item
  The false negative rate is \(P(negative| yes)= 0.3\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{inverse-probabilities}{%
\section{Inverse probabilities}\label{inverse-probabilities}}

We are interested in finding the probability of being infected if the test is positive: \[P(si| positive)\]

For that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We recover the contingency table for joint probabilities, multiplying by the marginal \(P(yes)\) and \(P(no)\) that we need to know
\end{enumerate}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
& Infection: yes & Infection: No & sum \\
\midrule
\endhead
Test: positive & P( positive {\textbar{}} yes)P(yes) & P(positive {\textbar{}} no)P(no) & P(positive) \\
Test: negative & P( negative {\textbar{}} yes)P(yes) & P(negative {\textbar{}} no) P(no) & P(negative) \\
sum & P(yes) & P(no) & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  We use the definition of conditional probabilities for rows instead of columns (we divide by the marginal of the test results)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
& Infection: yes & Infection: No & sum \\
\midrule
\endhead
Test: positive & P(yes{\textbar{}}positive) & P(no{\textbar{}}positive) & 1 \\
Test: negative & P(yes{\textbar{}}negative) & P(no{\textbar{}}negative) & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

For example:

\[P(yes| positive)= \frac{P(positive|yes)P(yes)}{P(positive)}\]

To apply this formula we need the marginals \(P(yes)\) (prevalence) and \(P(positive)\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The prevalence \(P(yes)\) needs to be given from another study. The first prevalence study in Spain showed that during confinement \(P(yes)=0.05\), \(P(no)=0.95\), before the summer of 2020.
\item
  To find the marginal of positives \(P(positive)\), we can then use the definition of marginal and conditional probability:
\end{itemize}

\(P(positive)= P(positive \cap yes) + P(positive \cap no)\)
\[= P(positive| yes)P (yes)+P(positive|no)P(no)\]
This last relation of the marginals is called \textbf{rule of total probability}.

\hypertarget{bayes-theorem}{%
\section{Bayes' Theorem}\label{bayes-theorem}}

After substituting the total probability rule into \(P(yes| positive)\) , we have

\[P(yes| positive)= \frac{P(positive|yes)P(yes)}{P(positive|yes)P(yes)+P(positive|no)P(no)}\]
This expression is known as \textbf{Bayes' theorem}. It allows us to reverse the conditionals:

\[P(positive|yes) \rightarrow P(yes| positive)\]
Or \textbf{assess} a test in a controlled condition (infection) and then use it to \textbf{infer} the probability of the condition when the test is positive.

\textbf{Example (COVID)}:

The test performance was:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sensitivity: \(P(positive| yes)= 0.70\)
\item
  False positive rate: \(P(positive| no)= 1- P(negative|no)=0.06\)
\end{itemize}

The study in the Spanish population gave:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(yes)=0.05\)
\item
  \(P(no)=1-P(yes)=0.95\).
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the probability of being infected in case of testing positive was:

\[P(yes| positive)= 0.38\]

We concluded that at that time PCR was not very good at \textbf{confirming} infections.

However, let us now apply Bayes' theorem to the probability of not being infected if the test was negative.

\[P(no|negative) = \frac{P(negative|no) P(no )}{ P(negative|no) P(no)+P(negative|yes)P(yes)}\]

Substituting all values gives

\[P(no| negative)= 0.98\]

So the tests were good for \textbf{ruling out} infections and a fair requirement for travel.

\textbf{Bayes's theorem}

In general, we can have more than two conditioning events. Therefore, Baye's theorem says:

If \(E1, E2, ..., Ek\) are \(k\) mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and \(B\) is any event, then the probability inverse \(P(Ei| B)\) is

\[P(Ei| B)= \frac{P(B|Ei)P(Ei)}{P(B|E1)P(E1) +...+ P(B|Ek)P(Ek)}\]
The denominator is the total probability rule for the marginal \(P(B)\), in terms of the marginals \(P(E1), P(E2), ... P(Ek)\).

\[P(B)=P(B|E 1)P (E1) +...+ P(B|Ek)P(Ek)\]

\textbf{Conditional tree}

The total probability rule can also be illustrated using a \textbf{conditional} tree.

\textbf{Rule of total probability} for the marginal of \(B\): In how many ways can I get the result \(B\)?

\(P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A')P(A')\)

We want to cross an avenue with two traffic lights. The probability of finding the first red light is 0.6. If we stop at the first traffic light, the probability of stopping at the second is 0.15. While the probability of stopping at the second if we don't stop at the first is 0.25.

When we try to cross both traffic lights:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the probability of having to stop at each traffic light? (R:0.09)
\item
  What is the probability of having to stop at at least one traffic light? (R:0.7)

\item
  If I stopped at the second traffic light, what is the probability that I would have to stop at the first? (R: 0.47)
\item
  If you were to stop at any traffic light, what is the probability that you would have to stop twice? (R: 0.12)
\item
  Is stopping at the first traffic light an independent event from stopping at the second traffic light? (No)
\end{itemize}

Now, we want to cross an avenue with three traffic lights. The probability of finding a red light only depends on the previous one. Specifically, the probability of finding a red traffic light given that the previous one was red is 0.15. While the probability of finding a fair traffic in red given that the previous one was in green is 0.25. Furthermore, the probability of finding the first red light is 0.6.

What is the probability of having to stop at each traffic light? (R:0.013)
- What is the probability of having to stop at at least one traffic light? (R:0.775)
- What is the probability of having to stop at a single traffic light? (R:0.5425)

tips:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the probability that a traffic light is red depends only on the previous one, then
  \(P(R_3|R_2,R_1)=P(R_3|R_2,\bar{R}_1)=P(R_3|R_2)\) and \(P(R_3|\bar{R}_2,R_1)=P(R_3|\bar{R}_2,\bar{R}_1)=P(R_3|\bar{R}_2)\)
\item
  The joint probability of finding three red lights can be written as:
  \(P(R_ 1,R _2,R_3)=P(R_3|R_2)P(R_2|R_1)P(R_1)\)
