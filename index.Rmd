I am also a lecturer of statistics at the [Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya](https://eebe.upc.edu/es). Previously, I was a post-doc in the [Institute of Psychiatry](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn) within Kingâ€™s college London and I hold a PhD in physics from the [Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/) at Cambridge University (UK).
