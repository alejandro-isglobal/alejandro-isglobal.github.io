We will do so using tables, figures, and descriptive statistics of central tendency and dispersion. We will also introduce key concepts in statistics such as randomized experiments, observations, outcomes, and absolute and relative frequencies. 2.1 Scientific method One of the goals of the scientific method is to provide a framework for solving problems that arise in the study of natural phenomena or in the design of new technologies. Modern humans have developed a method over thousands of years that is still in development. The method has three main human activities: Observation characterized by the acquisition of data Reason characterized by the development of mathematical models Action characterized by the development of new experiments (technology) Their complex interaction and results are the basis of scientific activity. 2.2 Statistics Statistics deals with the interaction between models and data (the bottom part of the figure). The statistical questions are: What is the best model for my data (inference)? What are the data that a certain model (prediction) would produce? 2.3 Data The data is presented in the form of observations. An Observation or Realization is the acquisition of a number or characteristic of an experiment. For example, let’s take the series of numbers produced by repeating an experiment (1: success, 0: failure). … 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 … The number in bold is an observation in a repeat of the experiment An outcome is a possible observation that is the result of an experiment. 1 is one result, 0 is the other result of the experiment. Remember that the observation is concrete is the number you get one day in the laboratory. The abstract result is one of the characteristics of the type of experiment you are running. 2.4 Result types In statistics we are mainly interested in two types of results. Categorical: If the result of an experiment is a quality. They can be nominal (binary: yes, no; multiple: colors) or ordinal when the qualities can be ranked (severity of a disease). Numeric: If the result of an experiment is a number. The number can be discrete (number of emails received in an hour, number of leukocytes in the blood) or continuous (battery charge status, engine temperature). 2.5 Random experiments It can be said that the subject of study of statistics is random experiments, the means by which we produce data. Definition: A random experiment is an experiment that gives different results when repeated in the same way. Randomized experiments are of different types, depending on how they are conducted: on the same object (person): temperature, sugar levels. different objects but of the same size: the weight of an animal. about events: the number of hurricanes per year. 2.6 Absolute frequencies When we repeat a randomized experiment with categorical results, we record a list of results. We summarize observations by counting how many times we saw a particular result. Absolute frecuency: \\[ n_i \\] is the number of times we observe the result \\(i\\). Example (leukocytes) Let’s take a leukocyte from a donor and write down its type. Let’s repeat the experiment \\(N=119\\) times. (T cell, T cell, Neutrophil, ..., B cell) The second T cell in bold is the second observation. The last B cell is observation number 119. We can list the results (categories) in a frequency table: ## outcome ni ## 1 T Cell 34 ## 2 B cell 50 ## 3 basophil 20 ## 4 Monocyte 5 ## 5 Neutrophil 10 From the table, we can say that, for example, \\(n_1=34\\) is the total number of T cells observed in the repeat experiment. We also note that the total number of repetitions \\(N=\\sum_i n_i = 119\\). 2.7 Relative frequencies We can also summarize observations by calculating the proportion of how many times we saw a particular result. \\[ f_i = n_i /N\\] where \\(N\\) is the total number of observations In our example, \\(n_1=34\\) T cells were recorded, so we asked about the proportion of T cells out of the total \\(119\\). We can add these proportions \\(f_i\\) in the frequency table. ## outcome ni fi ## 1 T Cell 34 0.28571429 ## 2 B cell 50 0.42016807 ## 3 basophil 20 0.16806723 ## 4 Monocyte 5 0.04201681 ## 5 Neutrophil 10 0.08403361 Relative frequencies are fundamental in statistics. They give the proportion of one result in relation to the other results. Later we will understand them as the observations of probabilities. For absolute and relative frequencies we have the properties \\(\\sum_{i=1..M} n_i = N\\) \\(\\sum_{i=1..M} f_i = 1\\) where \\(M\\) is the number of results. 2.8 Bar chart When we have a lot of results and want to see which ones are most likely, we can use a bar chart that is a number of \\(n_i\\) Vs the results. 2.9 Pie chart (pie) We can also visualize the relative frequencies with a pie chart. The area of the circle represents 100% of the observations (proportion = 1) and the sections the relative frequencies of each result. 2.10 Ordinal categorical variables The leukocyte type in the above examples is a categorical nominal variable. Each observation belongs to a category (quality). The categories do not always have a certain order . Sometimes categorical variables can be sorted when they meet a natural ranking. This allows you to compute cumulative frequencies. Example (Misophonia) This is a clinical study on 123 patients who were examined for their degree of misophonia. Misophnia is uncontrolled anxiety/anger produced by certain sounds . Each patient was evaluated with a questionnaire (AMISO) and they were classified into 4 different groups according to severity. The results of the study are ## [1] 4 2 0 3 0 0 2 3 0 3 0 2 2 0 2 0 0 3 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 4 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 2 ## [38] 3 2 2 0 2 3 0 0 2 2 3 3 0 0 4 3 3 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 1 3 2 4 3 2 3 ## [75] 0 2 3 2 4 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 4 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 2 1 3 0 0 3 2 1 3 0 4 4 2 3 3 ## [112] 3 0 3 2 1 2 3 3 4 2 3 2 Each observation is the result of a randomized experiment: measurement of the level of misophonia in a patient. This data series can be summarized in terms of the results in the frequency table ## outcome ni fi ## 1 0 41 0.33333333 ## 2 1 5 0.04065041 ## 3 2 37 0.30081301 ## 4 3 31 0.25203252 ## 5 4 9 0.07317073 2.11 Accumulated absolute and relative frequencies Misophonia severity is categorical ordinal because its results can be ordered relative to its degree. When the results can be ordered, it is useful to ask how many observations were obtained up to a given result. We call this number the absolute cumulative frequency up to the result \\(i\\): \\[N_i =\\sum_{k= 1..i } n_k\\] It is also useful for calculating the proportion of observations up to a given result. \\[F_i =\\sum_{k= 1..i } f_k\\] We can add these frequencies in the frequency table ## outcome ni fi Ni Fi ## 0 0 41 0.33333333 41 0.3333333 ## 1 1 5 0.04065041 46 0.3739837 ## 2 2 37 0.30081301 83 0.6747967 ## 3 3 31 0.25203252 114 0.9268293 ## 4 4 9 0.07317073 123 1.0000000 Therefore, 67% of patients had misophonia up to severity 2 and 37% of patients had severity less than or equal to 1. 2.12 Cumulative frequency graph \\(F_i\\) is an important quantity because it allows us to define the accumulation of probabilities down to intermediate levels. The probability of an intermediate level \\(x\\) (\\(i\\leq x&lt; i+1\\)) is just the accumulation up to the lower level \\(F_x = F_i\\). \\(F_x\\) is therefore a function on a continuous range of values. We can draw it with respect to the results. Therefore, we can say that 67% of the patients had misophonia up to severity \\(2.3\\), although \\(2.3\\) is not an observed outcome. 2.13 Numeric variables The result of a random experiment can produce a number. If the number is discrete, we can generate a frequency table, with absolute, relative, and cumulative frequencies, and illustrate them with bar, pie, and cumulative charts. When the number is continuous the frequencies are not useful, we are most likely to observe or not observe a particular continuous number. Example (misophonia) The researchers wondered if the convexity of the jaw would affect the severity of misophonia. The scientific hypothesis is that the angle of convexity of the jaw can influence hearing and its sensitivity. These are the mandibular convexity results (degrees) for each patient: ## [1] 7.97 18.23 12.27 7.81 9.81 13.50 19.30 7.70 12.30 7.90 12.60 19.00 ## [13] 7.27 14.00 5.40 8.00 11.20 7.75 7.94 16.69 7.62 7.02 7.00 19.20 ## [25] 7.96 14.70 7.24 7.80 7.90 4.70 4.40 14.00 14.40 16.00 1.40 9.76 ## [37] 7.90 7.90 7.40 6.30 7.76 7.30 7.00 11.23 16.00 7.90 7.29 6.91 ## [49] 7.10 13.40 11.60 -1.00 6.00 7.82 4.80 11.00 9.00 11.50 16.00 15.00 ## [61] 1.40 16.80 7.70 16.14 7.12 -1.00 17.00 9.26 18.70 3.40 21.30 7.50 ## [73] 6.03 7.50 19.00 19.01 8.10 7.80 6.10 15.26 7.95 18.00 4.60 15.00 ## [85] 7.50 8.00 16.80 8.54 7.00 18.30 7.80 16.00 14.00 12.30 11.40 8.50 ## [97] 7.00 7.96 17.60 10.00 3.50 6.70 17.00 20.26 6.64 1.80 7.02 2.46 ## [109] 19.00 17.86 6.10 6.64 12.00 6.60 8.70 14.05 7.20 19.70 7.70 6.02 ## [121] 2.50 19.00 6.80 2.14 Transforming continuous data Since continuous outcomes cannot be counted (informatively), we transform them into ordered categorical variables.

No other patients had an angle of \\(7.97\\), but many had angles between \\((7.92,12.4]\\). 2.15 Frequency table for a continuous variable For a given regular partition of the interval of results into intervals, we can produce a frequency table as before ## outcome ni fi Ni Fi ## 1 [-1.02,3.46] 8 0.06504065 8 0.06504065 ## 2 (3.46,7.92] 51 0.41463415 59 0.47967480 ## 3 (7.92,12.4] 26 0.21138211 85 0.69105691 ## 4 (12.4,16.8] 20 0.16260163 105 0.85365854 ## 5 (16.8,21.3] 18 0.14634146 123 1.00000000 2.16 Histogram The histogram is the graph of \\(n_i\\) or \\(f_i\\) Vs the results in intervals (bins). The histogram depends on the size of the bins . This is a histogram with 20 bins . We see that most people have angles within \\((7, 8]\\) 2.17 Cumulative frequency graph We can also plot \\(F_x\\) against the results. Since \\(F_x\\) is of continuous range, we can order the observations (\\(x_1 &lt;... x_j &lt; x_{j+1} &lt; x_n\\)) and therefore \\[F_x = \\frac{k}{ n}\\] for \\(x_{k} \\leq x &lt; x_{k+ 1}\\) . \\(F_x\\) is known as the distribution of the data. \\(F_x\\) does not depend on the size of the bin. However, its resolution depends on the amount of data. 2.18 Summary Statistics Summary statistics are numbers calculated from the data that tell us important characteristics of the numerical variables (discrete or continuous). For example, we have statistics that describe extreme values: minimum: the minimum result observed maximum: the maximum result observed 2.19 Average (sample mean) An important statistic that describes the central value of the results (where to expect most observations) is the average \\[\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j= 1..N } x_j \\] where \\(x_j\\) is the observation \\(j\\) out of a total of \\(N\\). Example (Misophonia) The average convexity can be calculated directly from the observations in the usual way \\(\\bar{x}= \\frac{1}{ N}\\sum_j x_j\\) \\(= \\frac{1}{ N}( 7.97 + 18.23 + 12.27... + 6.80) = 10.19894\\) For categorically ordered variables, we can also use the relative frequencies to calculate the average \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{ N}\\sum_{i=1...N} x_j =\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1...M} x_i n_ {i}=\\) \\[\\sum_{i=1...M} x_i f_{i}\\] where we went from adding \\(N\\) observations to adding \\(M\\) results. The form \\(\\bar{x}= \\sum_{i = 1...M} x_i f_i\\) shows that the average is the center of gravity of the results. As if each result had a mass density given by \\(f_i\\). Example (Misophonia) The average severity of misophonia in the study can be calculated from the relative frequencies of the outcomes ## outcome ni fi ## 1 0 41 0.33333333 ## 2 1 5 0.04065041 ## 3 2 37 0.30081301 ## 4 3 31 0.25203252 ## 5 4 9 0.07317073 \\(\\bar{x}=0*f_ {0}+ 1*f_{1}+2*f_{2}+3*f_{3}+4*f_{4}=1.691057\\) The average is also the center of gravity for continuous variables. That is the point where the relative frequencies balance. 2.20 Median Another measure of centrality is the median. The median \\(x_m\\), or \\(q_{0.5}\\), is the value below which we find half of the observations. When we order the observations \\(x_1 &lt;... x_j &lt; x_{j+1} &lt; x_N\\), we count them until we find half of them. Therefore, \\(x_m\\) is the observation such that \\(m\\) satisfies \\[\\sum_{i\\leq m} 1 = \\frac{N}{2}\\] Example (Misophonia) If we order the angles of convexity, we see that \\(62\\) observations (individuals) (\\(N/2 \\sim 123/2\\)) are below \\(7.96\\). The median convexity is therefore \\(q_{0.5}= x_{62}=7.96\\) ## [1] -1.00 -1.00 1.40 1.40 1.80 2.46 2.50 3.40 3.50 4.40 4.60 4.70 ## [13] 4.80 5.40 6.00 6.02 6.03 6.10 6.10 6.30 6.60 6.64 6.64 6.70 ## [25] 6.80 6.91 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.02 7.02 7.10 7.12 7.20 7.24 ## [37] 7.27 7.29 7.30 7.40 7.50 7.50 7.50 7.62 7.70 7.70 7.70 7.75 ## [49] 7.76 7.80 7.80 7.80 7.81 7.82 7.90 7.90 7.90 7.90 7.90 7.94 ## [61] 7.95 7.96 ## [1] 7.96 7.97 8.00 8.00 8.10 8.50 8.54 8.70 9.00 9.26 9.76 9.81 ## [13] 10.00 11.00 11.20 11.23 11.40 11.50 11.60 12.00 12.27 12.30 12.30 12.60 ## [25] 13.40 13.50 14.00 14.00 14.00 14.05 14.40 14.70 15.00 15.00 15.26 16.00 ## [37] 16.00 16.00 16.00 16.14 16.69 16.80 16.80 17.00 17.00 17.60 17.86 18.00 ## [49] 18.23 18.30 18.70 19.00 19.00 19.00 19.00 19.01 19.20 19.30 19.70 20.26 ## [61] 21.30 We cut the data at ## [1] 7.96 to split them in half. In terms of frequencies, \\(q_{0.5}\\) makes the cumulative frequency \\(F_x\\) equal to \\(0.5\\) \\[\\sum_{i = 0, ... m} f_i =F_{q_{0.5}}=0.5\\] that is \\[q_{ 0.5}= F^{-1}(0.5)\\] This last equation means that, in the distribution graph, the median \\(q_{ 0.5}\\) is the value of \\(x\\) at which we have climbed half of the total height of \\(F\\). The mean and median are not always the same. 2.21 Dispersion Other important summary statistics for observations are the spread statistics. Many experiments may share their mean, but differ in how sparse the values are. The dispersion of the observations is a measure of the noise. 2.22 Sample variance The dispersion about the mean is measured by the sample variance \\[s^2=\\frac{ 1}{ N-1} \\sum_{j=1..N} ( x_j -\\bar{x})^2\\] This number measures the average squared distance of the observations from the average. The reason for \\(N-1\\) will be explained when we talk about inference, when we study the spread of \\(\\bar{x}\\), as well as the spread of the observations. In terms of the frequencies of the variables that are categorical and ordered, we can also calculate the sample variance as \\[s^2=\\frac{N}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1... M} (x_i -\\bar{x})^2 f_i\\] \\(s^2\\) can be considered as the moment of inertia of the observations. The square root of the sample variance, \\(s\\), is called standard deviation of the sample. Example (Misophonia) The standard deviation of the angle of convexity is \\(s= [\\frac{ 1}{123-1}((7.97-10.19894)^2+ (18.23-10.19894)^2\\) \\[+ (12.27-10.19894 )^ 2 + ...)]^{1/2} = 5.086707\\] The jaw convexity deviates from its mean by \\(5.086707\\). 2.23 Interquartile range (IQR) The spread of the data can also be measured with respect to the median using the interquartile range: We define the first quartile as the value \\(x_m\\) that makes the cumulative frequency \\(F_{q_{0.25}}\\) equal to \\(0.25\\) (or the value of \\(x\\) where we have accumulated a quarter of the observations, or the value that splits the first quarter of the observations) \\[q_{0.25}=F^{-1}(0.25)\\] We define the third quartile as the value \\(x_m\\) that makes the cumulative frequency \\(F_{q_{0.75}}\\) equal to \\(0.75\\) (or the value of \\(x\\) where we have accumulated three quarters of observations) \\[q_{0.75}=F^{-1}(0.75)\\] The interquartile range (IQR) is \\[IQR=q_{0.75} - q_{0.25}\\] This is the distance between the third and first quartiles and captures the central \\(50\\%\\) of the observations 2.24 Boxplot The interquartile range, median, and \\(5\\%\\) and \\(95\\%\\) of the data can be displayed in a box plot. In the boxplot, the values of the results are on the y-axis. The IQR is the box, the median is the middle line, and the whiskers mark the \\(5\\%\\) and \\(95\\%\\) of the data. 2.25 Questions 1) In the following boxplot, the first quartile and second quartile of the data are: \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\((-1.00, 21.30)\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\((-1.00, 7.02)\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\((7.02, 7.96)\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\((7.02, 14.22)\\) 2) The main disadvantage of a histogram is that: \\(\\qquad\\) a : Depends on the size of the bin ; \\(\\qquad\\)b : Cannot be used for categorical variables; \\(\\qquad\\) c : Cannot be used when the bin size is small; \\(\\qquad\\) d : Used only for relative frequencies; 3) If the relative cumulative frequencies of a random experiment with outcomes \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) are: \\(F(1)=0.15, \\qquad F(2)=0.60, \\qquad F(3)=0.85, \\qquad F(4)=1\\). Then the relative frequency for the outcome \\(3\\) is \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(0.15\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(0.85\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(0.45\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(0.25\\) 4) In a sample of size \\(10\\) from a random experiment we obtained the following data: \\(8, \\qquad 3, \\qquad 3, \\qquad 7, \\qquad 3, \\qquad 6, \\qquad 5, \\qquad 10, \\qquad 3, \\qquad 8\\). The first quartile of the data is: \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(3.5\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(4\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(5\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(3\\) 5) Imagine that we collect data for two quantities that are not mutually exclusive, for example, the gender and nationality of passengers on a flight. If we want to make a single pie chart for the data, which of these statements is true? \\(\\qquad\\)a : We can only make a nationality pie chart because it has more than two possible outcomes; \\(\\qquad\\)b : We can make a pie graph for a new variable marking gender and nationality; \\(\\qquad\\)c : We can make a pie chart for the variable sex or the variable nationality; \\(\\qquad\\)d : We can only choose whether to make a pie chart for gender or a pie chart for nationality. 2.26 Exercises 2.26.0.1 Exercise 1 We have performed an experiment 8 times with the following results ## [1] 3 3 10 2 6 11 5 4 Answer the following questions: Calculate the relative frequencies of each result.
