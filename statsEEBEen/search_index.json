We will do so using tables, figures, and descriptive statistics of central tendency and dispersion. We will also introduce key concepts in statistics such as randomized experiments, observations, outcomes, and absolute and relative frequencies. 2.1 Scientific method One of the goals of the scientific method is to provide a framework for solving problems that arise in the study of natural phenomena or in the design of new technologies. Modern humans have developed a method over thousands of years that is still in development. The method has three main human activities: Observation characterized by the acquisition of data Reason characterized by the development of mathematical models Action characterized by the development of new experiments (technology) Their complex interaction and results are the basis of scientific activity. 2.2 Statistics Statistics deals with the interaction between models and data (the bottom part of the figure). The statistical questions are: What is the best model for my data (inference)? What are the data that a certain model (prediction) would produce? 2.3 Data The data is presented in the form of observations. An Observation or Realization is the acquisition of a number or characteristic of an experiment. For example, let’s take the series of numbers produced by repeating an experiment (1: success, 0: failure). … 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 … The number in bold is an observation in a repeat of the experiment An outcome is a possible observation that is the result of an experiment. 1 is one result, 0 is the other result of the experiment. Remember that the observation is concrete is the number you get one day in the laboratory. The abstract result is one of the characteristics of the type of experiment you are running. 2.4 Result types In statistics we are mainly interested in two types of results. Categorical: If the result of an experiment is a quality. They can be nominal (binary: yes, no; multiple: colors) or ordinal when the qualities can be ranked (severity of a disease). Numeric: If the result of an experiment is a number. The number can be discrete (number of emails received in an hour, number of leukocytes in the blood) or continuous (battery charge status, engine temperature). 2.5 Random experiments It can be said that the subject of study of statistics is random experiments, the means by which we produce data. Definition: A random experiment is an experiment that gives different results when repeated in the same way. Randomized experiments are of different types, depending on how they are conducted: on the same object (person): temperature, sugar levels. different objects but of the same size: the weight of an animal. about events: the number of hurricanes per year. 2.6 Absolute frequencies When we repeat a randomized experiment with categorical results, we record a list of results. We summarize observations by counting how many times we saw a particular result. Absolute frecuency: \\[ n_i \\] is the number of times we observe the result \\(i\\). Example (leukocytes) Let’s take a leukocyte from a donor and write down its type. Let’s repeat the experiment \\(N=119\\) times. (T cell, T cell, Neutrophil, ..., B cell) The second T cell in bold is the second observation. The last B cell is observation number 119. We can list the results (categories) in a frequency table: ## outcome ni ## 1 T Cell 34 ## 2 B cell 50 ## 3 basophil 20 ## 4 Monocyte 5 ## 5 Neutrophil 10 From the table, we can say that, for example, \\(n_1=34\\) is the total number of T cells observed in the repeat experiment. We also note that the total number of repetitions \\(N=\\sum_i n_i = 119\\). 2.7 Relative frequencies We can also summarize observations by calculating the proportion of how many times we saw a particular result. \\[ f_i = n_i /N\\] where \\(N\\) is the total number of observations In our example, \\(n_1=34\\) T cells were recorded, so we asked about the proportion of T cells out of the total \\(119\\). We can add these proportions \\(f_i\\) in the frequency table. ## outcome ni fi ## 1 T Cell 34 0.28571429 ## 2 B cell 50 0.42016807 ## 3 basophil 20 0.16806723 ## 4 Monocyte 5 0.04201681 ## 5 Neutrophil 10 0.08403361 Relative frequencies are fundamental in statistics. They give the proportion of one result in relation to the other results. Later we will understand them as the observations of probabilities. For absolute and relative frequencies we have the properties \\(\\sum_{i=1..M} n_i = N\\) \\(\\sum_{i=1..M} f_i = 1\\) where \\(M\\) is the number of results. 2.8 Bar chart When we have a lot of results and want to see which ones are most likely, we can use a bar chart that is a number of \\(n_i\\) Vs the results. 2.9 Pie chart (pie) We can also visualize the relative frequencies with a pie chart. The area of the circle represents 100% of the observations (proportion = 1) and the sections the relative frequencies of each result. 2.10 Ordinal categorical variables The leukocyte type in the above examples is a categorical nominal variable. Each observation belongs to a category (quality). The categories do not always have a certain order . Sometimes categorical variables can be sorted when they meet a natural ranking. This allows you to compute cumulative frequencies. Example (Misophonia) This is a clinical study on 123 patients who were examined for their degree of misophonia. Misophnia is uncontrolled anxiety/anger produced by certain sounds . Each patient was evaluated with a questionnaire (AMISO) and they were classified into 4 different groups according to severity. The results of the study are ## [1] 4 2 0 3 0 0 2 3 0 3 0 2 2 0 2 0 0 3 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 4 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 2 ## [38] 3 2 2 0 2 3 0 0 2 2 3 3 0 0 4 3 3 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 1 3 2 4 3 2 3 ## [75] 0 2 3 2 4 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 4 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 2 1 3 0 0 3 2 1 3 0 4 4 2 3 3 ## [112] 3 0 3 2 1 2 3 3 4 2 3 2 Each observation is the result of a randomized experiment: measurement of the level of misophonia in a patient. This data series can be summarized in terms of the results in the frequency table ## outcome ni fi ## 1 0 41 0.33333333 ## 2 1 5 0.04065041 ## 3 2 37 0.30081301 ## 4 3 31 0.25203252 ## 5 4 9 0.07317073 2.11 Accumulated absolute and relative frequencies Misophonia severity is categorical ordinal because its results can be ordered relative to its degree. When the results can be ordered, it is useful to ask how many observations were obtained up to a given result. We call this number the absolute cumulative frequency up to the result \\(i\\): \\[N_i =\\sum_{k= 1..i } n_k\\] It is also useful for calculating the proportion of observations up to a given result. \\[F_i =\\sum_{k= 1..i } f_k\\] We can add these frequencies in the frequency table ## outcome ni fi Ni Fi ## 0 0 41 0.33333333 41 0.3333333 ## 1 1 5 0.04065041 46 0.3739837 ## 2 2 37 0.30081301 83 0.6747967 ## 3 3 31 0.25203252 114 0.9268293 ## 4 4 9 0.07317073 123 1.0000000 Therefore, 67% of patients had misophonia up to severity 2 and 37% of patients had severity less than or equal to 1. 2.12 Cumulative frequency graph \\(F_i\\) is an important quantity because it allows us to define the accumulation of probabilities down to intermediate levels. The probability of an intermediate level \\(x\\) (\\(i\\leq x&lt; i+1\\)) is just the accumulation up to the lower level \\(F_x = F_i\\). \\(F_x\\) is therefore a function on a continuous range of values. We can draw it with respect to the results. Therefore, we can say that 67% of the patients had misophonia up to severity \\(2.3\\), although \\(2.3\\) is not an observed outcome. 2.13 Numeric variables The result of a random experiment can produce a number. If the number is discrete, we can generate a frequency table, with absolute, relative, and cumulative frequencies, and illustrate them with bar, pie, and cumulative charts. When the number is continuous the frequencies are not useful, we are most likely to observe or not observe a particular continuous number. Example (misophonia) The researchers wondered if the convexity of the jaw would affect the severity of misophonia. The scientific hypothesis is that the angle of convexity of the jaw can influence hearing and its sensitivity. These are the mandibular convexity results (degrees) for each patient: ## [1] 7.97 18.23 12.27 7.81 9.81 13.50 19.30 7.70 12.30 7.90 12.60 19.00 ## [13] 7.27 14.00 5.40 8.00 11.20 7.75 7.94 16.69 7.62 7.02 7.00 19.20 ## [25] 7.96 14.70 7.24 7.80 7.90 4.70 4.40 14.00 14.40 16.00 1.40 9.76 ## [37] 7.90 7.90 7.40 6.30 7.76 7.30 7.00 11.23 16.00 7.90 7.29 6.91 ## [49] 7.10 13.40 11.60 -1.00 6.00 7.82 4.80 11.00 9.00 11.50 16.00 15.00 ## [61] 1.40 16.80 7.70 16.14 7.12 -1.00 17.00 9.26 18.70 3.40 21.30 7.50 ## [73] 6.03 7.50 19.00 19.01 8.10 7.80 6.10 15.26 7.95 18.00 4.60 15.00 ## [85] 7.50 8.00 16.80 8.54 7.00 18.30 7.80 16.00 14.00 12.30 11.40 8.50 ## [97] 7.00 7.96 17.60 10.00 3.50 6.70 17.00 20.26 6.64 1.80 7.02 2.46 ## [109] 19.00 17.86 6.10 6.64 12.00 6.60 8.70 14.05 7.20 19.70 7.70 6.02 ## [121] 2.50 19.00 6.80 2.14 Transforming continuous data Since continuous outcomes cannot be counted (informatively), we transform them into ordered categorical variables.

No other patients had an angle of \\(7.97\\), but many had angles between \\((7.92,12.4]\\). 2.15 Frequency table for a continuous variable For a given regular partition of the interval of results into intervals, we can produce a frequency table as before ## outcome ni fi Ni Fi ## 1 [-1.02,3.46] 8 0.06504065 8 0.06504065 ## 2 (3.46,7.92] 51 0.41463415 59 0.47967480 ## 3 (7.92,12.4] 26 0.21138211 85 0.69105691 ## 4 (12.4,16.8] 20 0.16260163 105 0.85365854 ## 5 (16.8,21.3] 18 0.14634146 123 1.00000000 2.16 Histogram The histogram is the graph of \\(n_i\\) or \\(f_i\\) Vs the results in intervals (bins). The histogram depends on the size of the bins . This is a histogram with 20 bins . We see that most people have angles within \\((7, 8]\\) 2.17 Cumulative frequency graph We can also plot \\(F_x\\) against the results. Since \\(F_x\\) is of continuous range, we can order the observations (\\(x_1 &lt;... x_j &lt; x_{j+1} &lt; x_n\\)) and therefore \\[F_x = \\frac{k}{ n}\\] for \\(x_{k} \\leq x &lt; x_{k+ 1}\\) . \\(F_x\\) is known as the distribution of the data. \\(F_x\\) does not depend on the size of the bin. However, its resolution depends on the amount of data. 2.18 Summary Statistics Summary statistics are numbers calculated from the data that tell us important characteristics of the numerical variables (discrete or continuous). For example, we have statistics that describe extreme values: minimum: the minimum result observed maximum: the maximum result observed 2.19 Average (sample mean) An important statistic that describes the central value of the results (where to expect most observations) is the average \\[\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j= 1..N } x_j \\] where \\(x_j\\) is the observation \\(j\\) out of a total of \\(N\\). Example (Misophonia) The average convexity can be calculated directly from the observations in the usual way \\(\\bar{x}= \\frac{1}{ N}\\sum_j x_j\\) \\(= \\frac{1}{ N}( 7.97 + 18.23 + 12.27... + 6.80) = 10.19894\\) For categorically ordered variables, we can also use the relative frequencies to calculate the average \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{ N}\\sum_{i=1...N} x_j =\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1...M} x_i n_ {i}=\\) \\[\\sum_{i=1...M} x_i f_{i}\\] where we went from adding \\(N\\) observations to adding \\(M\\) results. The form \\(\\bar{x}= \\sum_{i = 1...M} x_i f_i\\) shows that the average is the center of gravity of the results. As if each result had a mass density given by \\(f_i\\). Example (Misophonia) The average severity of misophonia in the study can be calculated from the relative frequencies of the outcomes ## outcome ni fi ## 1 0 41 0.33333333 ## 2 1 5 0.04065041 ## 3 2 37 0.30081301 ## 4 3 31 0.25203252 ## 5 4 9 0.07317073 \\(\\bar{x}=0*f_ {0}+ 1*f_{1}+2*f_{2}+3*f_{3}+4*f_{4}=1.691057\\) The average is also the center of gravity for continuous variables. That is the point where the relative frequencies balance. 2.20 Median Another measure of centrality is the median. The median \\(x_m\\), or \\(q_{0.5}\\), is the value below which we find half of the observations. When we order the observations \\(x_1 &lt;... x_j &lt; x_{j+1} &lt; x_N\\), we count them until we find half of them. Therefore, \\(x_m\\) is the observation such that \\(m\\) satisfies \\[\\sum_{i\\leq m} 1 = \\frac{N}{2}\\] Example (Misophonia) If we order the angles of convexity, we see that \\(62\\) observations (individuals) (\\(N/2 \\sim 123/2\\)) are below \\(7.96\\). The median convexity is therefore \\(q_{0.5}= x_{62}=7.96\\) ## [1] -1.00 -1.00 1.40 1.40 1.80 2.46 2.50 3.40 3.50 4.40 4.60 4.70 ## [13] 4.80 5.40 6.00 6.02 6.03 6.10 6.10 6.30 6.60 6.64 6.64 6.70 ## [25] 6.80 6.91 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.02 7.02 7.10 7.12 7.20 7.24 ## [37] 7.27 7.29 7.30 7.40 7.50 7.50 7.50 7.62 7.70 7.70 7.70 7.75 ## [49] 7.76 7.80 7.80 7.80 7.81 7.82 7.90 7.90 7.90 7.90 7.90 7.94 ## [61] 7.95 7.96 ## [1] 7.96 7.97 8.00 8.00 8.10 8.50 8.54 8.70 9.00 9.26 9.76 9.81 ## [13] 10.00 11.00 11.20 11.23 11.40 11.50 11.60 12.00 12.27 12.30 12.30 12.60 ## [25] 13.40 13.50 14.00 14.00 14.00 14.05 14.40 14.70 15.00 15.00 15.26 16.00 ## [37] 16.00 16.00 16.00 16.14 16.69 16.80 16.80 17.00 17.00 17.60 17.86 18.00 ## [49] 18.23 18.30 18.70 19.00 19.00 19.00 19.00 19.01 19.20 19.30 19.70 20.26 ## [61] 21.30 We cut the data at ## [1] 7.96 to split them in half. In terms of frequencies, \\(q_{0.5}\\) makes the cumulative frequency \\(F_x\\) equal to \\(0.5\\) \\[\\sum_{i = 0, ... m} f_i =F_{q_{0.5}}=0.5\\] that is \\[q_{ 0.5}= F^{-1}(0.5)\\] This last equation means that, in the distribution graph, the median \\(q_{ 0.5}\\) is the value of \\(x\\) at which we have climbed half of the total height of \\(F\\). The mean and median are not always the same. 2.21 Dispersion Other important summary statistics for observations are the spread statistics. Many experiments may share their mean, but differ in how sparse the values are. The dispersion of the observations is a measure of the noise. 2.22 Sample variance The dispersion about the mean is measured by the sample variance \\[s^2=\\frac{ 1}{ N-1} \\sum_{j=1..N} ( x_j -\\bar{x})^2\\] This number measures the average squared distance of the observations from the average. The reason for \\(N-1\\) will be explained when we talk about inference, when we study the spread of \\(\\bar{x}\\), as well as the spread of the observations. In terms of the frequencies of the variables that are categorical and ordered, we can also calculate the sample variance as \\[s^2=\\frac{N}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1... M} (x_i -\\bar{x})^2 f_i\\] \\(s^2\\) can be considered as the moment of inertia of the observations. The square root of the sample variance, \\(s\\), is called standard deviation of the sample. Example (Misophonia) The standard deviation of the angle of convexity is \\(s= [\\frac{ 1}{123-1}((7.97-10.19894)^2+ (18.23-10.19894)^2\\) \\[+ (12.27-10.19894 )^ 2 + ...)]^{1/2} = 5.086707\\] The jaw convexity deviates from its mean by \\(5.086707\\). 2.23 Interquartile range (IQR) The spread of the data can also be measured with respect to the median using the interquartile range: We define the first quartile as the value \\(x_m\\) that makes the cumulative frequency \\(F_{q_{0.25}}\\) equal to \\(0.25\\) (or the value of \\(x\\) where we have accumulated a quarter of the observations, or the value that splits the first quarter of the observations) \\[q_{0.25}=F^{-1}(0.25)\\] We define the third quartile as the value \\(x_m\\) that makes the cumulative frequency \\(F_{q_{0.75}}\\) equal to \\(0.75\\) (or the value of \\(x\\) where we have accumulated three quarters of observations) \\[q_{0.75}=F^{-1}(0.75)\\] The interquartile range (IQR) is \\[IQR=q_{0.75} - q_{0.25}\\] This is the distance between the third and first quartiles and captures the central \\(50\\%\\) of the observations 2.24 Boxplot The interquartile range, median, and \\(5\\%\\) and \\(95\\%\\) of the data can be displayed in a box plot. In the boxplot, the values of the results are on the y-axis. The IQR is the box, the median is the middle line, and the whiskers mark the \\(5\\%\\) and \\(95\\%\\) of the data. 2.25 Questions 1) In the following boxplot, the first quartile and second quartile of the data are: \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\((-1.00, 21.30)\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\((-1.00, 7.02)\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\((7.02, 7.96)\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\((7.02, 14.22)\\) 2) The main disadvantage of a histogram is that: \\(\\qquad\\) a : Depends on the size of the bin ; \\(\\qquad\\)b : Cannot be used for categorical variables; \\(\\qquad\\) c : Cannot be used when the bin size is small; \\(\\qquad\\) d : Used only for relative frequencies; 3) If the relative cumulative frequencies of a random experiment with outcomes \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) are: \\(F(1)=0.15, \\qquad F(2)=0.60, \\qquad F(3)=0.85, \\qquad F(4)=1\\).

We will define the events as the elements on which the probability is applied. Composite events will be defined using set algebra. Then we will discuss the concept of conditional probability derived from the joint probability of two events. 3.1 Random experiments Let’s remember the basic objective of statistics. Statistics deals with data that is presented in the form of observations. An observation is the acquisition of a number or characteristic from an experiment Observations are realizations of results. An outcome is a possible observation that is the result of an experiment. When conducting experiments, we often get different results. The description of the variability of the results is one of the objectives of statistics. A random experiment is an experiment that gives different results when repeated in the same way. The philosophical question behind it is how can we know something if every time we look at it it changes? 3.2 Measurement probability We would like to have a measure for the outcome of a randomized experiment that tells us how sure we are of observing the outcome when we perform a future randomized experiment. We will call this measure the probability of the outcome and assign values to it: 0, when we are sure that the observation will not occur. 1, when we are sure that the observation will happen. 3.3 Classical probability As long as a random experiment has \\(M\\) possible outcomes that are all equally likely, the probability of each \\(i\\) outcome is \\[P_i =\\frac{1}{ M}\\]. Classical probability was defended by Laplace (1814). Since every outcome is equally likely in this type of experiment, we declare complete ignorance and the best we can do is equally distribute the same probability for each outcome. We do not observe \\(P_i\\) We deduce \\(P_i\\) from our ratio and we don’t need to carry out any experiment to know it. Example (dice): What is the probability that we will get \\(2\\) on the roll of a die? \\(P_2=1/6=0.166666\\). 3.4 Relative frequencies What about random experiments whose possible outcomes are not equally likely? How then can we define the probabilities of the outcomes? Example (random experiment) Imagine that we repeat a random experiment \\(8\\) times and obtain the following observations 8 4 12 7 10 7 9 12 How sure are we of obtaining the result \\(12\\) in the following observation? The frequency table is ## outcome ni fi ## 1 4 1 0.125 ## 2 7 2 0.250 ## 3 8 1 0.125 ## 4 9 1 0.125 ## 5 10 1 0.125 ## 6 12 2 0.250 The relative frequency \\(f_i =\\frac{ n_ i }{ N}\\) seems like a reasonable probability measure because is a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). measures the proportion of the total number of observations that we observe of a particular result. Since \\(f_{12}=0.25\\) then we would be one quarter sure, one out of every 4 observations, of getting \\(12\\). Question: How good is \\(f_i\\) as a measure of certainty of the result \\(i\\)? Example (random experiment with more repetitions) Let’s say we repeat the experiment 100,000 more times: The frequency table is now ## outcome ni fi ## 1 2 2807 0.02807 ## 2 3 5607 0.05607 ## 3 4 8435 0.08435 ## 4 5 11070 0.11070 ## 5 6 13940 0.13940 ## 6 7 16613 0.16613 ## 7 8 13806 0.13806 ## 8 9 10962 0.10962 ## 9 10 8402 0.08402 ## 10 11 5581 0.05581 ## 11 12 2777 0.02777 and the barplot is New results came out and \\(f_{12}\\) is now only \\(0.027\\), and so we are only \\(\\sim 3\\%\\) sure to get \\(12\\) in the next experiment. The probabilities measured by \\(f_i\\) change with \\(N\\). 3.5 Relative frequencies at infinity A crucial observation is that if we measure the probabilities of \\(f_i\\) in increasing values of \\(N\\) they converge! In this graph each vertical section gives the relative frequency of each observation. We see that after \\(N=1000\\) (\\(log10(N)=3\\)) the proportions hardly change with more \\(N\\). We find that each of the relative frequencies \\(f_i\\) converges to a constant value \\[lim_{N\\rightarrow \\infty} f_i = P_i\\] 3.6 Frequentist probability We call Probability \\(P_i\\) the limit as \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) of the relative frequency of observing the outcome \\(i\\) in a random experiment. Defended by Venn (1876), the frequentist definition of probability is derived from (empirical) data/experience. We do not observe \\(P_i\\), we observe \\(f_i\\) We estimate \\(P_i\\) with \\(f_i\\) (usually when \\(N\\) is large), we write: \\[\\hat {P_ i}= f_i\\] Similar to the relationship between observation and result, we have the relationship between relative frequency and probability as a concrete value of an abstract quantity. 3.7 Classical and frequentist probabilities We have situations where classical probability can be used to find the limit of relative frequencies: If the results are equally probable, the classical probability gives us the limit: \\[P_i=lim_{N\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{n_i}{N}=\\frac{1}{M}\\] If the results in which we are interested can be derived from other equally probable results. We will see more about this when we study probability models. Example (sum of two dice) Our previous example is based on the sum of two dice. Although we perform the experiment many times, write down the results, and calculate the relative frequencies, we can know the exact value of probability. This probability follows from the fact that the outcome of each die is equally likely. From this assumption, we can find that (Exercise 1) \\[ P_i = \\begin{cases} \\frac{i-1}{36},&amp; i \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6, 7\\} \\\\ \\frac{13-i}{36},&amp; i \\in \\{8,9,10,11,12\\} \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] The motivation of the frequentist definition is empirical (data) while that of the classical definition is rational (models). We often combine both approaches (inference and deduction) to find out the probabilities of our random experiment. 3.8 Definition of probability A probability is a number that is assigned to each possible outcome of a random experiment and satisfies the following properties or axioms: when the results \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are mutually exclusive; that is, only one of them can occur, so the probability of observing \\(E_1\\) or \\(E_1\\), written as \\(E_1\\cup E_2\\), is their sum: \\[ P( E_1\\cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2)\\] when \\(S\\) is the set of all possible outcomes, then its probability is \\(1\\) (at least something is observed): \\[P(S)=1\\] The probability of any outcome is between 0 and 1 \\[P(E) \\in [0,1]\\] Proposed by Kolmogorov’s less than 100 years ago (1933) 3.9 Probabilities Table Kolmogorov properties are the basic rules for building a probability table, similar to the relative frequency table. Example (dice) The probability table for the throw of a dice result probability \\(1\\) 1/6 \\(2\\) 1/6 \\(3\\) 1/6 \\(4\\) 1/6 \\(5\\) 1/6 \\(6\\) 1/6 \\(P( 1 \\cup 2\\cup ... \\cup 6)\\) 1 Let’s verify the axioms: Where \\(1 \\cup 2\\) is, for example, the event of rolling a \\(1\\) or a \\(2\\). So \\[ P( 1 \\cup 2)=P(1)+P(2)=2/6\\] Since \\(S= \\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) is made up of mutually exclusive outcomes, then \\[P(S)=P(1\\cup 2\\cup ... \\cup 6) = P(1)+P(2)+ ...+P(n)=1\\] The probabilities of each outcome are between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). 3.10 Sample space The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space and is denoted \\(S\\). The sample space can be made up of categorical or numerical outcomes. For example: human temperature: \\(S = (36, 42)\\) degrees Celsius. sugar levels in humans: \\(S =( 70-80) mg/ dL\\) the size of a production line screw: \\(S =( 70-72) mm\\) number of emails received in an hour: \\(S = \\{ 1, ...\\infty \\}\\) the throw of a dice: \\(S= \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) 3.11 Events An event \\(A\\) is a subset of the sample space. It is a collection of posible results. Examples of events: The event of a healthy temperature: \\(A=37-38\\) degrees Celsius The event of producing a screw with a size: \\(A=71.5mm\\) The event of receiving more than 4 emails in an hour: \\(A= \\{ 4, \\infty \\}\\) The event of obtaining a number less than or equal to 3 in the roll of a says: \\(A= \\{ 1,2,3\\}\\) An event refers to a possible set of outcomes. 3.12 Algebra of events For two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we can construct the following derived events using the basic set operations: Complement \\(A&#39;\\): the event of not \\(A\\) Union \\(A \\cup B\\): the event of \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) Intersection \\(A \\ cap B\\): the event of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) Example (dice) Let’s roll a die and look at the events (result set): a number less than or equal to three \\(A:\\{ 1,2,3\\}\\) an even number \\(B:\\{ 2,4,6\\}\\) Let’s see how we can build new events with set operations: a number not less than three: \\(A &#39;:\\{4,5,6\\}\\) a number less than or equal to three or even: \\(A \\cup B: \\{ 1,2,3,4,6\\}\\) a number less than or equal to three and even \\(A \\cap B: \\{ 2\\}\\) 3.13 Mutually exclusive results Outcomes like rolling \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) on a die are events that cannot occur at the same time. We say that they are mutually exclusive. In general, two events denoted as \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) are mutually exclusive when \\[E_1\\cap E_2=\\emptyset\\] Examples: The result of having a misophonia severity of \\(1\\) and a severity of \\(4\\). The results of obtaining \\(12\\) and \\(5\\) by adding the throw of two dice. According to the Kolmogorov properties , only mutually exclusive outcomes can be arranged in probability tables, as in relative frequency tables. 3.14 Joint probabilities The joint probability of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the probability of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). That’s \\[P( A \\cap B)\\] or \\(P(A,B)\\). To write joint probabilities of non mutually exclusive events (\\(A \\cap B \\neq \\emptyset\\)) into a probability table, we note that we can always decompose the sample space into mutually exclusive sets involving the intersections: \\(S=\\{A\\cap B, A \\cap B&#39;, A&#39;\\cap B, A&#39;\\cap B&#39;\\}\\) Let’s consider the Ven diagram for the example where \\(A\\) is the event that corresponds to drawing a number less than or equal to 3 and \\(B\\) corresponds to an even number: The marginals of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the probability of \\(A\\) and the probability of \\(B\\), respectively: \\(P(A)=P(A\\cap B&#39;) + P(A \\cap B)=2/6+1/6=3/6\\) \\(P(B)=P(A&#39;\\cap B) +P(A \\cap B)=2/6+1/6=3/6\\) We can now write the probability table for the joint probabilities Result probability \\((A\\cap B)\\) \\(P(A \\cap B)=1/6\\) \\((A\\cap B&#39;)\\) \\(P(A \\cap B&#39;)=2/6\\) \\((A&#39;\\cap B)\\) \\(P(A&#39; \\cap B)=2/6\\) \\((A&#39;\\cap B&#39;)\\) \\(P(A&#39; \\cap B&#39;)=1/6\\) sum \\(1\\) Each result has \\(two\\) values (one for the feature of type \\(A\\) and one for type \\(B\\)) 3.15 Contingency table The joint probability table can also be written in a contingency table \\(B\\) \\(B&#39;\\) sum \\(A\\) \\(P(A \\cap B )\\) \\(P(A\\cap B&#39; )\\) \\(P(A)\\) \\(A&#39;\\) \\(P(A&#39;\\cap B )\\) \\(P(A&#39;\\cap B&#39; )\\) \\(P(A&#39;)\\) sum \\(P(B)\\) \\(P(B&#39;)\\) 1 Where the marginals are the sums in the margins of the table, for example: \\(P(A)=P(A \\cap B&#39;) + P(A \\cap B)\\) \\(P(B)=P(A&#39; \\cap B) +P(A \\cap B)\\) In our example, the contingency table is \\(B\\) \\(B&#39;\\) sum \\(A\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(2/6\\) \\(3/6\\) \\(A&#39;\\) \\(2/6\\) \\(1/6\\) \\(3/6\\) sum \\(3/6\\) \\(3/6\\) \\(1\\) 3.16 The addition rule: The addition rule allows us to calculate the probability of \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), \\(P( A \\cup B)\\), in terms of the probability of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(P(A \\cup B )\\). We can do this in three equivalent ways: Using the marginals and the joint probability \\[P(A \\cup B)=P(A) + P(B) - P(A\\cap B)\\] Using only joint probabilities \\[P( A \\cup B)=P(A \\cap B)+P(A\\cap B&#39;)+P(A&#39;\\cap B)\\] Using the complement of joint probability \\[P(A \\cup B)=1-P(A&#39;\\cap B&#39;)\\] Example (dice) Take the events \\(A:\\{ 1,2,3\\}\\), rolling a number less than or equal to \\(3\\), and \\(B:\\{2,4,6\\}\\), rolling an even number on the roll of a dice. Therefore: \\(P( A \\cup B)=P(A) + P(B) - P(A\\cap B)=3/6+3/6-1/6=5/6\\) \\(P(A \\cup B)=P(A \\cap B)+P(A\\cap B&#39;)+P(A&#39;\\cap B)=1/6+2/6+2/6=5/6\\) \\(P(A \\cup B)=1-P(A&#39;\\cap B&#39;)= 1-1/6=5/6\\) In the contingency table \\(P( A \\cup B)\\) corresponds to the cells in bold (method 2 above). That is all cells but 1/6 from the bottom right (method 3). \\(B\\) \\(B&#39;\\) \\(A\\) 1/6 2/6 \\(A&#39;\\) 2/6 1/6 3.17 Questions We collect the age and category of 100 athletes in a competition \\(age:junior\\) \\(age:senior\\) \\(category:1st\\) \\(14\\) \\(12\\) \\(category:2nd\\) \\(21\\) \\(18\\) \\(category:3rd\\) \\(22\\) \\(13\\) 1) What is the estimated probability that an athlete is 2nd category and senior? \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(18/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(18/43\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(18\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(18/39\\) 2) What is the estimated probability that the athlete is not in the third category and is senior? \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(35/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(30/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(22/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(13/100\\) 3) What is the marginal probability of the third category? \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(13/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(35/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(22/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(13/22\\) 4) What is the marginal probability of being senior? \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(13/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(43/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(43/57\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(57/100\\) 5) What is the probability of being senior or third category? \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(65/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(86/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(78/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(13/100\\) 3.18 Exercises 3.18.0.1 Classical probability: Exercise 1 Write the table of joint probability for the results of rolling two dice; In the rows write the results of the first die and in the columns the results of the second die.

We will use conditional probability to define statistical independence. We will discuss Bayes’ theorem and we will discuss one of its main applications, which is the predictive efficiency of a diagnostic tool. 4.1 Joint probability Recall that the joint probability of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is defined as their intersection \\[P( A ,B )=P(A \\cap B)\\] Now imagine randomized experiments that measure two different types of outcomes. height and weight of an individual: \\((h, w)\\) time and position of an electric charge: \\((p, t)\\) the throw of two dice: (\\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\)) cross two green traffic lights: (\\(\\bar{ R_ 1}\\) , \\(\\bar{R_2}\\)) We are often interested in whether the values of one result condition the values of the other. 4.2 Statistical independence In many cases, we are interested in whether two events often tend to occur together. We want to be able to discern between two cases. Independence between events. For example, rolling a 1 on one die does not make it more likely to roll another 1 on a second die. Correlation between events. For example, if a man is tall, he is probably heavy. Example (conductor) We conducted an experiment to find out if observing structural flaws in a material affects its conductivity. The data would look like Conductor Structure conductivity \\(c_1\\) flaws low \\(c_2\\) no flaws high \\(c_3\\) flaws low … … … \\(c_i\\) no flaws low* … … … … … … \\(c_n\\) flaws high* We can expect low conductivity to occur more often with flaws than without flaws if the flaws affect conductivity. Let’s imagine that from the data we obtain the following contingency table of estimated joint probabilities with flaws (F) no flaws (F’) sum low (L) \\(0.005\\) \\(0.045\\) \\(0.05\\) high (L’) \\(0.095\\) \\(0.855\\) \\(0.95\\) sum \\(0.1\\) \\(0.9\\) 1 where, for example, the joint probability of \\(L\\) and \\(F\\) is \\(P(L,F )=0.005\\) and the marginal probabilities are \\(P(L)=P(L, F) + P(L, F&#39;)=0.05\\) \\(P(F)=P(L, F) + P(L&#39;, F)= 0.1\\). 4.3 The conditional probability Low conductivity is independent of having structural flaws if the probability of having low conductivity (\\(L\\)) is the same whether it has flaws (\\(F\\)) or not (\\(F&#39;\\) ) . Let us first consider only the materials that have flaws. Among those materials that have flaws (\\(F\\)), what is the estimated probability that they have low conductivity? \\(\\hat{P}(L| F)= \\frac{n_{L,F}}{n_{F}}=\\frac{n_{L,F}/n}{n_{F}/n}= \\frac{f_{L,F}}{f_{F}}\\) \\[= \\frac{\\hat{P}( L,F )}{\\hat{P}(F)}\\] Therefore, in the limit when \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\), we have \\[P(L| F)= \\frac{P(L,F)}{P(D)}=\\frac{P(L\\cap F)}{P(D)}\\] Definition: The conditional probability of an event \\(B\\) given an event \\(A\\), denoted \\(P(A| B)\\) , is \\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] We can prove that conditional probability satisfies the axioms of probability. The conditional probability can be understood as a probability with a sample space given by \\(B\\): \\(S_B\\). In our example, the materials with stuctural flaw. 4.4 Conditional contingency table If we divide the columns of the joint probability table by the marginal probabilities of the conditioning effects (\\(F\\) and \\(F&#39;\\)), we can write a conditional contingency table F F’ L P( L | F) P(L | F’) L’ P(L’ | F) P(L’ | F’) sum 1 1 where the column probabilities sum to one. The first column shows the probabilities of low conductivity or not only of the materials that have flaws (first condition: \\(F\\)). The second column shows the probabilities only for the materials that have no flaws (second condition: \\(F&#39;\\)). Conditional probabilities are the probabilities of the event within each condition. We read them as: \\(P(L| F)\\): Probability of having low conductivity if it has flaws \\(P(L&#39;| F)\\): Probability of not having low conductivity if it has flaws \\(P(L|F &#39;)\\): Probability of having low conductivity if it has no flaws \\(P(L&#39;|F &#39;)\\): Probability of not having low conductivity if it has no flaws 4.5 Statistical independence In our example, the conditional contingency table is F F’ L P(L|F) = 0.05 P(L|F’)= 0.05 L’ P(L’|F)=0.95 P(L’|F’)=0.95 sum 1 1 We note that the marginal and conditional probabilities are the same! \\(P(L| F)= P(L|F&#39;)=P(L)\\) \\(P(L&#39;| F)= P(L&#39;|F&#39;)=P(L&#39;)\\) This means that the probability of observing a low conductivity is not dependent on having a structural flaw or not. We conclude that low conductivity is not affected by having a structural flaw. Definition Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are statistically independent if either of the equivalent cases occurs. \\(P(A| B)= P(A)\\); \\(A\\) is independent of \\(B\\) \\(P(B| A)= P(B)\\); \\(B\\) is independent of \\(A\\) and by the definition of conditional probability \\(P(A\\cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)=P(A)P(B)\\) This third form is a statement about joint probabilities. It says that we can obtain joint probabilities by multiplying the marginal ones. In our original joint probability table F F’ sum L \\(0.005\\) \\(0.045\\) \\(0.05\\) L’ \\(0.095\\) \\(0.855\\) \\(0.95\\) sum \\(0.1\\) \\(0.9\\) 1 we can confirm that all the entries of the matrix are the product of the marginal ones. For example: \\(P(F)P(L)= P( L \\cap F)\\) and \\(P(L&#39;)P(F&#39;)=P(L&#39; \\cap F&#39;)\\). Therefore, low conductivity is independent of having a structural flaw. Example (Coins) We want to confirm that the results of tossing two coins are independent. We consider all outcomes to be equally likely: result probability \\(( H,T )\\) 1/4 \\(( H,H )\\) 1/4 \\(( T,T )\\) 1/4 \\(( T, H )\\) 1/4 sum 1 where \\(( H,T )\\) is, for example, the event of heads on the first coin and tails on the second coin. The contingency table for the joint probabilities is: H T sum H \\(1/4\\) \\(1/4\\) \\(1/2\\) T \\(1/4\\) \\(1/4\\) \\(1/2\\) sum \\(1/2\\) \\(1/2\\) 1 From this table, we see that the probability of getting a head and then a tail is the product of the marginals \\(P( H, T)=P(H)*P(T)=1/4\\). Therefore, the events of heads in the first coin and tails in the second are independent. If we build the conditional contingency table on the toss of the first coin, we will see that obtaining tails in the second coin is not conditioned by having obtained heads in the first coin: \\(P(T| H)= P(T) =1 / 2\\) 4.6 Statistical dependency An important example of statistical dependency is found in the performance of diagnostic tools, where we want to determine the state of a system(s) with results satisfactory (yes) unsatisfactory (not) with a test (t) with results positive negative For example, we test a battery to see how long it can last. We load a cable to find out if it resists carrying a certain load. We run a PCR to see if someone is infected. 4.7 Diagnostic test Let’s consider diagnosing an infection with a new test. Infection status: yes (infected) no (not infected) Test: positive negative The conditional contingency table is what we get in a controlled environment (laboratory) Infection: yes Infection: No Test: positive P(positive | yes) P(positive | no) Test: negative P(negative | yes) P(negative | no) sum 1 1 Let’s look at the table entries 1) Rate of true positives (Sensitivity): The probability of testing positive if you have the disease \\(P(positive| yes)\\) Rate of true negatives (Specificity): The probability of testing negative if you do not have the disease \\(P(negative| no)\\) False positive rate: the probability of testing positive if you do not have the disease \\(P(positive| no)\\) False negative rate: the probability of testing negative if you have the disease \\(P(negative| yes)\\) High correlation (statistical dependence) between test and infection means high values for probabilities 1 and 2 and low values for probabilities 3 and 4. Example (COVID) Now let’s consider a real situation. In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, there was no measure of the effectiveness of PCRs in detecting the virus. One of the first published studies (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2015897) found that The PCR had a sensitivity of 70%, in infection condition. The PCR had a specificity of 94%, in non-infected condition. The conditional contingency table is Infection: yes Infection: No Test: positive P(positive| yes)= 0.7 P(positive|no)=0.06 Test: negative P(negative| yes)= 0.3 P(negative|no)=0.94 sum 1 1 Therefore, the errors in the diagnostic tests were: The false positive rate is \\(P(positive| no)= 0.06\\) The false negative rate is \\(P(negative| yes)= 0.3\\) 4.8 Inverse probabilities We are interested in finding the probability of being infected if the test is positive: \\[P(si| positive)\\] For that: We recover the contingency table for joint probabilities, multiplying by the marginal \\(P(yes)\\) and \\(P(no)\\) that we need to know Infection: yes Infection: No sum Test: positive P( positive | yes)P(yes) P(positive | no)P(no) P(positive) Test: negative P( negative | yes)P(yes) P(negative | no) P(no) P(negative) sum P(yes) P(no) 1 We use the definition of conditional probabilities for rows instead of columns (we divide by the marginal of the test results) Infection: yes Infection: No sum Test: positive P(yes|positive) P(no|positive) 1 Test: negative P(yes|negative) P(no|negative) 1 For example: \\[P(yes| positive)= \\frac{P(positive|yes)P(yes)}{P(positive)}\\] To apply this formula we need the marginals \\(P(yes)\\) (prevalence) and \\(P(positive)\\). The prevalence \\(P(yes)\\) needs to be given from another study. The first prevalence study in Spain showed that during confinement \\(P(yes)=0.05\\), \\(P(no)=0.95\\), before the summer of 2020. To find the marginal of positives \\(P(positive)\\), we can then use the definition of marginal and conditional probability: \\(P(positive)= P(positive \\cap yes) + P(positive \\cap no)\\) \\[= P(positive| yes)P (yes)+P(positive|no)P(no)\\] This last relation of the marginals is called rule of total probability. 4.9 Bayes’ Theorem After substituting the total probability rule into \\(P(yes| positive)\\) , we have \\[P(yes| positive)= \\frac{P(positive|yes)P(yes)}{P(positive|yes)P(yes)+P(positive|no)P(no)}\\] This expression is known as Bayes’ theorem. It allows us to reverse the conditionals: \\[P(positive|yes) \\rightarrow P(yes| positive)\\] Or assess a test in a controlled condition (infection) and then use it to infer the probability of the condition when the test is positive. Example (COVID): The test performance was: Sensitivity: \\(P(positive| yes)= 0.70\\) False positive rate: \\(P(positive| no)= 1- P(negative|no)=0.06\\) The study in the Spanish population gave: \\(P(yes)=0.05\\) \\(P(no)=1-P(yes)=0.95\\). Therefore, the probability of being infected in case of testing positive was: \\[P(yes| positive)= 0.38\\] We concluded that at that time PCR was not very good at confirming infections. However, let us now apply Bayes’ theorem to the probability of not being infected if the test was negative. \\[P(no|negative) = \\frac{P(negative|no) P(no )}{ P(negative|no) P(no)+P(negative|yes)P(yes)}\\] Substituting all values gives \\[P(no| negative)= 0.98\\] So the tests were good for ruling out infections and a fair requirement for travel. Bayes’s theorem In general, we can have more than two conditioning events. Therefore, Baye’s theorem says: If \\(E1, E2, ..., Ek\\) are \\(k\\) mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and \\(B\\) is any event, then the probability inverse \\(P(Ei| B)\\) is \\[P(Ei| B)= \\frac{P(B|Ei)P(Ei)}{P(B|E1)P(E1) +...+ P(B|Ek)P(Ek)}\\] The denominator is the total probability rule for the marginal \\(P(B)\\), in terms of the marginals \\(P(E1), P(E2), ... P(Ek)\\). \\[P(B)=P(B|E 1)P (E1) +...+ P(B|Ek)P(Ek)\\] Conditional tree The total probability rule can also be illustrated using a conditional tree. Rule of total probability for the marginal of \\(B\\): In how many ways can I get the result \\(B\\)? \\(P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A&#39;)P(A&#39;)\\) 4.10 Questions We collect the age and category of 100 athletes in a competition \\(junior\\) \\(senior\\) \\(1st\\) \\(14\\) \\(12\\) \\(2nd\\) \\(21\\) \\(18\\) \\(3rd\\) \\(22\\) \\(13\\) 1) What is the estimated probability that the athlete is in the third category if the athlete is a junior? \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(22\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(22/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(22/57\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(22/35\\); 2) What is the estimated probability that the athlete is a junior and is in the 1st category if the athlete is not in the 3rd category? \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(14/35\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(14/65\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(14/100\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(14/26\\) 3) A diagnostic test has a probability of \\(8/9\\) of detecting a disease if the patients are sick and a probability of \\(3/9\\) of detecting the disease if the patients are healthy.

If we stop at the first traffic light, the probability of stopping at the second is 0.15. While the probability of stopping at the second if we don’t stop at the first is 0.25.

The probability of encountering the first red light is 0.6, and the probability of encountering a red light at the second signal depends solely on the probability of the first light. Similarly, the probability of encountering a red light at the third signal depends only on the probabilities of the second light. As previously mentioned, the probability of stopping at a traffic light is 0.15 if we stopped at the previous light. If we didn’t stop at the previous one, the probability of stopping at a traffic light is 0.25. What is the probability of having to stop at each traffic light?

(R:0.5425) tips: If the probability that a traffic light is red depends only on the previous one, then \\(P(R_3|R_2,R_1)=P(R_3|R_2,\\bar{R}_1)=P(R_3|R_2)\\) and \\(P(R_3|\\bar{R}_2,R_1)=P(R_3|\\bar{R}_2,\\bar{R}_1)=P(R_3|\\bar{R}_2)\\) The joint probability of finding three red lights can be written as: \\(P(R_ 1,R _2,R_3)=P(R_3|R_2)P(R_2|R_1)P(R_1)\\) 4.11.0.5 Exercise 5 A quality test on a random brick is defined by the events: Pass the quality test: \\(E\\), fail the quality test: \\(\\bar{E}\\) Defective: \\(D\\), non-defective: \\(\\bar{D}\\) If the diagnostic test has sensitivity \\(P(E|\\bar{D })= 0.99\\) and specificity \\(P(\\bar{E}|D)=0.98\\), and the probability of passing the test is \\(P(E) =0.893\\) then What is the probability that a randomly chosen brick is defective \\(P(D)\\)?

We will define the probability mass function and its main properties of mean and variance. Following the abstraction process of the relative frequencies into probabilities we also define the probability distribution as the limiting case of the relative cumulative frequency. 5.2 Relative frequencies Relative frequencies of the outcomes of a random experiment are a measure of their propensity. We can used them as estimators of their probabilities, when the we repeat the random experiment a lot of times (\\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\)). We defined central tendency (average), dispersion (sample variance) and the frequency distribution the data (\\(F_i\\)). In terms of probabilities, how are this quantities defined? 5.3 Random variable We defined the relative frequencies on the observations of the experiments. We now define the equivalent quantities for probabilities in terms of the outcomes of the experiments. We will deal with numerical outcomes only. A random variable is a symbol that represents a numerical outcome of a random experiment. We write the random variable in capitals (i.e. \\(X\\)). Definition: A random variable is a function that assigns a real number to an event from the sample space of a random experiment. Remember than an event can be an outcome or a collection of outcomes. When the random variable takes a value, it indicates the realization of an event of a random experiment. Example: If \\(X \\in \\{0,1\\}\\), we then say \\(X\\) is a random variable that can take the values \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). 5.4 Events of observing a random variable We make the distinction between variables in the model space with capital letters, as abstract entities, and the realization of a particular event or outcome. For instance: \\(X=1\\) is the event of observing the random variable \\(X\\) with value \\(1\\) \\(X=2\\) is the event of observing the random variable \\(X\\) with value \\(2\\) … In general: \\(X=x\\) is the event of observing the random variable \\(X\\) (big \\(X\\)) with value \\(x\\) (little \\(x\\)). 5.5 Probability of random variables We are interested in assigning probabilities to the events of observing a particular value of a random variable. For instance for the dice we will write the probability table as \\(X\\) Probability \\(1\\) \\(P(X=1)=1/6\\) \\(2\\) \\(P(X=2)=1/6\\) \\(3\\) \\(P(X=3)=1/6\\) \\(4\\) \\(P(X=4)=1/6\\) \\(5\\) \\(P(X=5)=1/6\\) \\(6\\) \\(P(X=6)=1/6\\) where we make explicit the events that the variable takes a given outcome \\(X=x\\). 5.6 Probability functions Because (little) \\(x\\) is a numerical variable, the probabilities of the random variable can be plotted or written as the mathematical function \\[f(x)=P(X=x)=1/6\\] 5.7 Probability functions We can create any type of probability function if we satisfy Kolmogorov’s probability rules: For a discrete random variable \\(X \\in \\{x_1 , x_2 , .. , x_M\\}\\), a probability mass function that is used to compute probabilities \\(f(x_i)=P(X=x_i)\\) is always positive \\(f(x_i)\\geq 0\\) and its sum over all the values of the variable is \\(1\\): \\(\\sum_{i=1}^M f(x_i)=1\\) Where \\(M\\) is the number of possible outcomes. Note that the definition of \\(X\\) and its probability mass function is general without reference to any experiment. The functions live in the model (abstract) space. Here is an example \\(X\\) and \\(f(x)\\) are abstract objects that may or may not map to an experiment. We have the freedom to construct them as we want as long as we respect their definition. Probability mass functions have some properties that are derived exclusively from their definition. 5.8 Probabilities and relative frequencies Consider the example Make following set-up: In one urn put \\(8\\) balls and: mark \\(1\\) ball with \\(-2\\) mark \\(2\\) balls with \\(-1\\) mark \\(2\\) balls with \\(0\\) mark \\(2\\) balls with \\(1\\) mark \\(1\\) ball with \\(2\\) And consider performing the following random experiment: Take one ball and read the number. From the classical probability, we can write the probability table, for which we do not need to run any experiment \\(X\\) \\(P(X=x)\\) \\(-2\\) \\(1/8=0.125\\) \\(-1\\) \\(2/8=0.25\\) \\(0\\) \\(2/8=0.25\\) \\(1\\) \\(2/8=0.25\\) \\(2\\) \\(1/8=0.125\\) Now, let’s perform the experiment \\(30\\) times and write the frequency table \\(X\\) \\(f_i\\) \\(-2\\) \\(0.132\\) \\(-1\\) \\(0.262\\) \\(0\\) \\(0.240\\) \\(1\\) \\(0.248\\) \\(2\\) \\(0.118\\) The frequentist probability tells us \\[lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} f_i = f(x_i)=P(X=x_i)\\] Then, if we did not know the set up of the experiment (black box), the best we can do is to estimate the probabilities with the frequencies, obtained from \\(N\\) repetitions of the random experiment: \\[f_i = \\hat{P}_i\\] Everytime we estimate the probabilities, our estimates \\(\\hat{P}_i=f_i\\) change. But \\(P_i\\) is an abstract quantity that never changes. As \\(N\\) increases we get closer to it. 5.9 Mean or expected value When we discussed summary statistics of data, we defined the centre of the observations as a value around which the outcome frequencies are concentrated. We used the average to measure the centre of gravity of the data. In terms of the relative frequencies of the values of discrete outcomes, we wrote the average as \\(\\bar{x}= \\sum_{i=1}^M x_i \\frac{n_i}{N}=\\) \\[\\sum_{i=1}^M x_i f_i\\] Definition The mean (\\(\\mu\\)) or expected value of a discrete random variable \\(X\\), \\(E(X)\\), with mass function \\(f(x)\\) is given by \\[ \\mu = E(X)= \\sum_{i=1}^M x_i f(x_i) \\] It is the center of gravity of the probabilities: The point where probability loading on a road are balanced. From the definition we have \\[\\bar{x} \\rightarrow \\mu\\] in the limit when \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) as the frequency tends to the probability mass fucntion \\(f_i \\rightarrow f(x_i)\\). Example What is the mean of \\(X\\) if its probability mass function \\(f(x)\\) is given by \\(X\\) \\(f(x)=P(X=x)\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/16\\) \\(1\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(2\\) \\(6/16\\) \\(3\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(4\\) \\(1/16\\) \\[ \\mu =E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i f(x_i) \\] \\(E(X)=\\)0 * 1/16 + 1 * 4/16 + 2 * 6/16 + 3 * 4/16 + 4 * 1/16 =2 The mean \\(\\mu\\) is the centre of gravity of the probability mass function it does not change. However, the average \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the centre of gravity of the observations (relative frequencies) it changes with different data. 5.10 Variance When we discussed summary statistics of data, we also defined the spread of the observations as an average distance from the data average. Definition The variance, written as \\(\\sigma^2\\) or \\(V(X)\\), of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) with mass function \\(f(x)\\) is given by \\[\\sigma^2 = V(X)= \\sum_{i=1}^M (x_i-\\mu)^2 f(x_i)\\] \\(\\sigma=\\sqrt{V(X)}\\) is called the standard deviation of the random variable. Teh variance is the spread of the probabilities about the mean: The moment of inertia of probabilities about the mean. Example What is the variance of \\(X\\) if its probability mass function \\(f(x)\\) is given by \\(X\\) \\(f(x)=P(X=x)\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/16\\) \\(1\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(2\\) \\(6/16\\) \\(3\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(4\\) \\(1/16\\) \\[\\sigma^2 =V(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i-\\mu)^2 f(x_i)\\] \\(V(X)=\\)(0-2)\\(^2\\)* 1/16 + (1-2)\\(^2\\)* 4/16 + (2-2)\\(^2\\)* 6/16 + (3-2)\\(^2\\)* 4/16 + (4-2)\\(^2\\)* 1/16 =1 \\[V(X)=\\sigma^2=1\\] \\[\\sigma=1\\] 5.11 Probability functions for functions of \\(X\\) In many occasions, we will be interested in outcomes that are function of the random variables. Perhaps, we are interested in the square of the number of flu infections, or on the square root of the number of emails in an hour. Definition For any function \\(h\\) of a random variable \\(X\\), with mass function \\(f(x)\\), its expected value is given by \\[ E[h(X)]= \\sum_{i=1}^M h(x_i) f(x_i) \\] This is an important definition that allows us to prove three frequently used properties of the mean and variance: The mean of a linear function is the linear function fo the mean: \\[E(a\\times X +b)= a\\times E(X) +b\\] for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) scalars (numbers). The variance of a linear function of \\(X\\) is:\\[V(a\\times X +b)= a^2\\times V(X)\\] The variance about the origin is the variance about the mean plus the mean squared: \\[E(X^2)=V(X)+E(X)^2\\] Example What is the variance \\(X\\) about the origin, \\(E(X^2)\\), if its probability mass function \\(f(x)\\) is given by \\(X\\) \\(f(x)=P(X=x)\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/16\\) \\(1\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(2\\) \\(6/16\\) \\(3\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(4\\) \\(1/16\\) \\[E(X^2) =\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i^2 f(x_i)\\] \\(E(X^2)=\\)(0)\\(^2\\)* 1/16 + (1)\\(^2\\)* 4/16 + (2)\\(^2\\)* 6/16 + (3)\\(^2\\)* 4/16 + (4)\\(^2\\)* 1/16 =5 We can also verify: \\[E(X^2)=V(X)+E(X)^2\\] \\(5=1+2^2\\) 5.12 Probability distribution When we discussed summary statistics of data, we also defined the frequency distribution (or the relative cumulative frequency) \\(F_i\\). \\(F_i\\) is an important quantity because it is a continuous function \\(F_x\\) is therefore a continuous function, even if the outcomes are discrete. Definition: The probability distribution function is defined as \\[F(x)=P(X\\leq x)=\\sum_{x_i\\leq x} f(x_i) \\] That is the accumulated probability up to a given value \\(x\\) \\(F(x)\\) satisfies therefore satisifies: \\(0\\leq F(x) \\leq 1\\) If \\(x \\leq y\\), then \\(F(x) \\leq F(y)\\) For the probability mass function: \\(X\\) \\(f(x)=P(X=x)\\) \\(0\\) \\(1/16\\) \\(1\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(2\\) \\(6/16\\) \\(3\\) \\(4/16\\) \\(4\\) \\(1/16\\) The probability distribution is: \\[ F(x)= \\begin{cases} 1/16,&amp; \\text{if } 0 \\leq x &lt; 1\\\\ 5/16,&amp; 1\\leq x &lt; 2\\\\ 11/16,&amp; 2\\leq x &lt; 3\\\\ 15/16,&amp; 4\\leq x &lt; 5\\\\ 16/16,&amp; x \\leq 5\\\\ \\end{cases} \\] For\\(X \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) 5.13 Probability function and probability distribution The probability function and distribution are equivalent. We can get one from the other and vice-versa \\[f(x_i)=F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})\\] with \\[f(x_1)=F(x_1)\\] for \\(X\\) taking values in \\(x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq ... \\leq x_n\\) Example From probability distribution: \\[ F(x)= \\begin{cases} 1/16,&amp; \\text{if } 0 \\leq x &lt; 1\\\\ 5/16,&amp; 1\\leq x &lt; 2\\\\ 11/16,&amp; 2\\leq x &lt; 3\\\\ 15/16,&amp; 4\\leq x &lt; 5\\\\ 16/16,&amp; x \\leq 5\\\\ \\end{cases} \\] We can obtain the probability mas function. \\(f(0)=F(0)=1/16\\) \\(f(1)=F(1)-f(0)=5/32-1/32=4/16\\) \\(f(2)=F(2)-f(1)-f(0)=F(2)-F(1)=6/16\\) \\(f(3)=F(3)-f(2)-f(1)-f(0)=F(3)-F(2)=4/16\\) \\(f(4)=F(4)-F(3)=1/16\\) 5.14 Quantiles Finally, we can use the probability distribution \\(F(x)\\) to define the median and the quartiles of the radom variable \\(X\\). In general, we define the q-quantile as the value \\(x_{p}\\) under which we have accumulated q*100% of the probability \\[q=\\sum_{i=1}^p f(x_i) = F (x_p)\\] The median is value \\(x_m\\) such that \\(q=0.5\\) \\[F(x_{m})=0.5\\] The \\(0.05\\)-quantile is the value \\(x_{r}\\) such that \\(q=0.05\\) \\[F(x_{r})=0.05\\] The \\(0.25\\)-quantile is first quartile the value \\(x_{s}\\) such that \\(q=0.25\\) \\[F(x_{s})=0.25\\] 5.15 Summary quantity names model (unobserved) data (observed) probability mass function // relative frequency \\(f(x_i)=P(X=x_i)\\) \\(f_i=\\frac{n_i}{N}\\) probability distribution // cumulative relative frequency \\(F(x_i)=P(X \\leq x_i)\\) \\(F_i=\\sum_{k\\leq i} f_k\\) mean // average \\(\\mu=E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^M x_i f(x_i)\\) \\(\\bar{x}=\\sum_{j=1}^N x_j/N\\) variance // sample variance \\(\\sigma^2=V(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^M (x_i-\\mu)^2 f(x_i)\\) \\(s^2=\\sum_{j=1}^N (x_j-\\bar{x})^2/(N-1)\\) standard deviation // sample sd \\(\\sigma=\\sqrt{V(X)}\\) \\(s\\) variance about the origin // 2nd sample moment \\(E(X^2)=\\sum_{i=1}^M x_i^2 f(x_i)\\) \\(m_2= \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j^2/n\\) Note that: \\(i=1...M\\) is an outcome of the random variable \\(X\\). \\(j=1...N\\) is an observation of the random variable \\(X\\).

We will define the probability density function, its mean and variance and, similar to discrete random variables, we will define the probability distribution function. 6.2 Continuous random variables In the last chapter we used the probabilities of discrete random variables to define the probability mass function \\[f(x)=P(X= x)\\] Where the probability that the random variable takes the value \\(x\\) is understood as the value of its relative frequency, when the number of repetitions of the random experiment tends to infinity. When we talked about continuous data, we saw that we had to transform them into discrete variables (bins) to produce relative frequency tables or histograms. Let’s see how to define the probabilities of continuous variables taking these partitions into account. Example (misophonia) Let us reconsider the angle of convexity of patients with misophonia (Section 2.21). The angle of convexity of 123 patients was measured. We understood each measurement as the result of a random experiment that we repeated 123 times and that we could describe in a frequency table or in a histogram. To do this, we redefine the results as small regular intervals (bins) and calculate the relative frequency of each interval. ## outcome ni fi ## 1 [-1.02,3.46] 8 0.06504065 ## 2 (3.46,7.92] 51 0.41463415 ## 3 (7.92,12.4] 26 0.21138211 ## 4 (12.4,16.8] 20 0.16260163 ## 5 (16.8,21.3] 18 0.14634146 6.3 relative frequencies Relative frequencies for the intervals are the probabilities when \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) \\[f_i=\\frac{n_i}{N} \\rightarrow P(x_i \\leq X \\leq x_i + \\Delta x)\\] The probability depends now on the length of the bins \\(\\Delta x\\). If we make the bins smaller and smaller then the frequencies get smaller and therefore \\[P(x_i \\leq X \\leq x_i + \\Delta x) \\rightarrow 0\\] when \\(\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0\\), because \\(n_i \\rightarrow 0\\) Let’s see how the frequencies get smaller when we divide the range of \\(X\\) into \\(20\\) bins ## outcome ni fi ## 1 [-1.02,0.115] 2 0.01626016 ## 2 (0.115,1.23] 0 0.00000000 ## 3 (1.23,2.34] 3 0.02439024 ## 4 (2.34,3.46] 3 0.02439024 ## 5 (3.46,4.58] 2 0.01626016 ## 6 (4.58,5.69] 4 0.03252033 ## 7 (5.69,6.8] 11 0.08943089 ## 8 (6.8,7.92] 34 0.27642276 ## 9 (7.92,9.04] 12 0.09756098 ## 10 (9.04,10.2] 4 0.03252033 ## 11 (10.2,11.3] 3 0.02439024 ## 12 (11.3,12.4] 7 0.05691057 ## 13 (12.4,13.5] 2 0.01626016 ## 14 (13.5,14.6] 6 0.04878049 ## 15 (14.6,15.7] 4 0.03252033 ## 16 (15.7,16.8] 8 0.06504065 ## 17 (16.8,18] 4 0.03252033 ## 18 (18,19.1] 9 0.07317073 ## 19 (19.1,20.2] 3 0.02439024 ## 20 (20.2,21.3] 2 0.01626016 6.4 probability density function We define a quantity at a point \\(x\\) that is the amount of probability per unit distance that we would find in an infinitesimal bin \\(dx\\) at \\(x\\) \\[f(x)= \\frac{P(x\\leq X \\leq x+dx)}{dx}\\] \\(f(x)\\) is called the probability density function. Therefore, the probability of observing \\(x\\) between \\(x\\) and \\(x+dx\\) is given by \\[P(x\\leq X \\leq x+dx)= f(x) dx\\] Definition For a continuous random variable \\(X\\), a probability density function is such that The function is positive: \\[f(x) \\geq 0\\] The probability of observing any value is 1: \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 1\\] 3) The probability of observing a value within an interval is the area under the curve: \\[P(a\\leq X \\leq b)=\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx\\] The properties make sure that \\(f(x)dx\\) satisfy Kolmogorov’s properties of a probability measure. The probability density function is a step forward in the abstraction of probabilities: we add the continuous limit \\[dx \\rightarrow 0\\] All the properties of probabilities are translated in terms of densities \\[\\sum \\rightarrow \\int\\] Probability densities are mathematical quantities that do not necessarily represent random experiments. A fundamental interest in statistics is to describe the densities that describe our particular random experiment. 6.5 Total area under the curve Example (raindrop fall) take the probability density that may describe the random variable that measures where a raindrop falls in a rain gutter of length \\(100cm\\). \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{100},&amp; \\text{if } x\\in (0,100)\\\\ 0,&amp; otherwise \\end{cases} \\] Let us verify that the function satisfies the three properties of a probability density. it is evident from the definition that \\(f(x) \\geq 0\\) The probability of observing anything is the total area under the curve \\(P(-\\infty\\leq X \\leq \\infty)= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 100*0.01= 1\\) The probability of observing \\(x\\) in an interval is the area under the curve within the interval \\(P(20 \\leq X \\leq 60) = \\int_{20}^{60} f(x) dx = (60-20)*0.01=0.4\\) 6.6 Probabilities of continous variables For continuous variables, we compute the probability that the variable is in a given interval. That is \\[P(a \\leq X \\leq b)\\] We saw that for continuous variables, the probability that the experiment gives us a particular real number is zero: \\(P(X=a)=0\\) The \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b)\\) is the area under the curve of \\(f(x)\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx\\) 6.7 Probability distribution The probability distribution \\(F(c)\\) defined as the accumulation of probability up to the outcome \\(C\\) \\(F(c) = P(X \\leq c)\\) can be used to compute the probability \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b)\\). Consider: that the probability accumulated up to \\(b\\) is given by \\(F(b) = P(X \\leq b)=\\int_{-\\infty}^bf(x)dx\\) that the probability accumulated up to \\(a\\) is \\(F(a) = P(X \\leq a)\\) Then the probability between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is given by the difference in the value of the probability distribution \\(P(a\\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)\\) Definition The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is defined as \\[F(a)=P(X\\leq a) =\\int_{-\\infty} ^a f(x)dx\\] and have the properties: It is between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\): \\[F(-\\infty)= 0 \\,\\, and \\,\\,F(\\infty)=1\\] It always increases: \\[F(a)\\leq F(b)\\] if \\(a\\leq b\\) It can be used to compute probabilities: \\[P(a \\leq X \\leq b)=F(b)-F(a)\\] It recovers the probability density: \\[f(x)=\\frac{dF(x)}{dx}\\] We use probability distributions to compute probabilities of a random variable within intervals, and its derivative is the probability density function. Example (raindrop fall) For the uniform density function: \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{100},&amp; \\text{if } x\\in (0,100)\\\\ 0,&amp; otherwise \\end{cases} \\] We find that the probability distribution is \\[ F(a)= \\begin{cases} 0,&amp; a \\leq 0 \\\\ \\frac{a}{100},&amp; \\text{if } a\\in (0,100)\\\\ 1, &amp; 100 \\leq a \\\\ \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] 6.8 Probability plots We can plot the the probability of a random variable in an interval as the area under the density curve. For instance \\[P(20&lt;X&lt;60)\\] Equivalenty, we can plot the probability \\(P(20&lt;X&lt;60)\\) as the difference in distribution values 6.9 Mean As in the discrete case, the mean measures the center of mass of probabilities Definition Suppose \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable with probability density function \\(f(x)\\). The mean or expected value of \\(X\\), denoted as \\(\\mu\\) or \\(E(X)\\), is \\[\\mu=E(X)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x) dx\\] It is the continuous version of the center of mass. Example (raindrop fall) The random variable with probability density \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{100},&amp; \\text{if } x\\in (0,100)\\\\ 0,&amp; otherwise \\end{cases} \\] Has an expected value at \\[E(X)=50\\] 6.10 Variance As in the discrete case, the variance measures the dispersion of probabilities about the mean Definition Suppose \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable with probability density function \\(f(x)\\). The variance of \\(X\\), denoted as \\(\\sigma^2\\) or \\(V(X)\\), is \\[\\sigma^2=V(X)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-\\mu)^2 f(x) dx\\] It is the continuous version of the moment of inertia. 6.11 Functions of \\(X\\) In many occasions, we will be interested in outcomes that are function of the random variables. Perhaps, we are interested in the square of the elongation of a spring, or on the square root of the temperature of an engine. Definition For any function \\(h\\) of a random variable \\(X\\), with mass function \\(f(x)\\), its expected value is given by \\[E[h(X)]= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(x) f(x)dx\\] From this definition we recover the same properties as in the discrete case The mean of a linear function is the linear function fo the mean: \\[E(a\\times X +b)= a\\times E(X) +b\\] for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) scalars. The variance of a linear function of \\(X\\) is:\\[V(a\\times X +b)= a^2\\times V(X)\\] The variance about the origin is the variance about the mean plus the mean squared: \\[E(X^2)=V(X)+E(X)^2\\] 6.12 Exercises 6.12.0.1 Exercise 1 For the probability density \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{100},&amp; \\text{if } x\\in (0,100)\\\\ 0,&amp; otherwise \\end{cases} \\] compute the mean (R:50) compute variance using \\(E(X^2)=V(X)+E(X)^2\\) (R:100^2/12) compute \\(P(\\mu-\\sigma\\leq X \\leq \\mu+\\sigma)\\) (R: 0.57) What are the first and third quartiles?

In particular, we will discuss the uniform and Bernoulli probability functions and how they are used to derive the binomial and negative binomial probability functions. 7.2 Probability mass function Let us remenber that a probability mass function of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) with possible values \\(x_1 , x_2 , .. , x_M\\) is any function such that It Allows us to compute probabilities for all outcomes \\[f(x_i)=P(X=x_i)\\] It is always positive: \\[f(x_i)\\geq 0\\] The probability of of obtaining anything in the random experiment is \\(1\\) \\[\\sum_{i=1}^M f(x_i)=1\\] We studied two important properties: The mean as a measure of central tendency: \\[E(X)= \\sum_{i=1}^M x_i f(x_i)\\] The variance as a measure of dispersion: \\[V(X)= \\sum_{i=1}^M (x_i-\\mu)^2 f(x_i)\\] 7.3 Probability model A probability model is a probability mass function that may represent the probabilities of a random experiment. Examples: The probability mass function defined by \\(X\\) \\(f(x)\\) \\(-2\\) \\(1/8\\) \\(-1\\) \\(2/8\\) \\(0\\) \\(2/8\\) \\(1\\) \\(2/8\\) \\(2\\) \\(1/8\\) Represents the probability of drawing one ball from an urn where there are two balls with labels: \\(-1, 0, 1\\) and one ball with labels: \\(-2, 2\\). \\(f(x)=P(X=x)=1/6\\) represents the probability of the outcomes of one throw of a dice. 7.4 Parametric models When we have a random experiment with \\(M\\) possible outcomes, we need to find \\(M\\) numbers to determine the probability mass function. As in the previous example 1, we needed \\(5\\) values in the column \\(f(x)\\) of the probability table. However, in many cases, we can formulate probability functions \\(f(x)\\) that depend on very few numbers only. As in the previous example 2, we only needed to know how many possible outcomes the throw of a dice has. Example (classical probability): A random experiment with \\(M\\) equally likely outcomes has a probability mass function: \\[f(x)=P(X=x)=1/M\\] We only need to know \\(M\\). The numbers we need to know to fully determine a probability function are called parameters. 7.5 Uniform distribution (one parameter) The previous example is the classical interpretation of probability, and defines our first parametric model. Definition A random variable \\(X\\) with outcomes \\(\\{1,...M\\}\\) has a discrete uniform distribution if all its \\(M\\) outcomes have the same probability \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{M}\\] \\(M\\) is the natural parameter of the model. Once we define \\(M\\) for an experiment, we choose a particular probability mass function. The function above is really a family of functions that depend on \\(M\\): \\(f(x; M)\\). The mean and variance of a variable that follows a uniform distribution are: \\[E(X)= \\frac{M+1}{2}\\] and \\[V(X)= \\frac{M^2-1}{12}\\] Note: \\(E(X)\\) and \\(V(X)\\) are also parameters. If we know any of them then we can fully determine the distribution. For instance: \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{2E(X)-1}\\] Let’s look at some probability mass functions in the family of uniform parametric models: 7.6 Uniform distribution (two parameters) Let’s introduce a new uniform probability model with two parameters: The minimum and maximum outcomes. If the random variable takes values in \\(\\{a, a+1, ...b\\}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers and all the outcomes are equally probable then \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{b-a+1}\\] as \\(M=b-a+1\\). We then say that \\(X\\) distributes uniformly between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and write \\[X \\rightarrow Unif(a,b)\\] Properties: If \\(X\\) distributes uniformly between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) \\[X \\rightarrow Unif(a,b)\\] Its mean is \\[E(X)= \\frac{b+a}{2}\\] Its variance is \\[V(X)= \\frac{(b-a+1)^2-1}{12}\\] To prove this change variables \\(X=Y+a-1\\), \\(y \\in \\{1,...M\\}\\). Probability mass functions Let’s look at some probability mass functions in the family of uniform parametric models: Example (school classes): What is the probability of observing a child of a particular age in a primary school (if all classes have the same amount of children)? From the set up of the experiment we know: \\(a=6\\) and \\(b=11\\) then \\[X \\rightarrow Unif(a=6, b=11)\\] that is \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{6}\\] for \\(x\\in \\{6,7,8,9,10,11\\}\\), and \\(0\\) otherwise. The mean and variance for this probability mass function is: \\(E(X)=8.5\\) \\(V(X)=2.916667\\) Remember that The expected value is the mean \\(\\mu=8.5\\) The standard deviation \\(\\sigma=1.707825\\) is the average distance from the mean and is computed from the square root of the variance. Parameters and Models: A model is a particular function \\(f(x)\\) that describes our experiment. If the model is a known function that depends on a few parameters then changing the value of the parameters we produce a family of models: \\(f(x; a,b)\\). Knowledge of \\(f(x)\\) is reduced to the knowledge of the value of the parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\). Ideally, the model and the parameters are interpretable. In our example, \\(a\\) represents the the minimum age at school and \\(b\\) the maximum age. They can be considered as the physical properties of the experiment. 7.7 Bernoulli trial Let’s try to advance from the equal probability case and suppose a model with only two possible outcomes (\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)) that have unequal probabilities Examples: Writing down the sex of a patient who goes into an emergency room of a hospital (\\(A:male\\) and \\(B:female\\)). Recording whether a manufactured machine is defective or not (\\(A:defective\\) and \\(B:not \\,\\, defective\\)). Hitting a target (\\(A:success\\) and \\(B:failure\\)). Transmitting one pixel correctly (\\(A:yes\\) and \\(B:no\\)). In these examples, the probability of outcome \\(A\\) is usually unknown. Probability model: We will introduce the probability of an outcome (\\(A\\)) as the parameter of the model. The model can be written in different forms As a probability table: \\(Outcome\\) \\(P_i\\) \\(A\\) \\(p\\) \\(B\\) \\(1-p\\) \\(i \\in \\{A,B\\}\\) outcome A (success): has probability \\(p\\) (parameter) outcome B (failure): has a probability \\(1-p\\) As a probability mass function of the random variable \\(K\\) taking values \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\) for \\(B\\) and \\(A\\), respectively. \\[ f(k)= \\begin{cases} 1-p,&amp; k=0\\, (event\\, B)\\\\ p,&amp; k=1\\, (event\\, A) \\end{cases} \\] As a concise probability mass function \\[f(k; p)=p^k(1-p)^{1-k} \\] for \\(k=(0,1)\\). We then say that \\(X\\) follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameter \\(p\\) \\[X \\rightarrow Bernoulli(p)\\] Properties: If \\(X\\) follows a Bernoulli distribution then its mean is \\[E(K)=p\\] its variance is \\[V(K)=(1-p)p\\] Note that the probability of the outcome \\(A\\) is the parameter \\(p\\) which is the same as its value at \\(1\\): \\(f(1)=P(X=1)\\). The parameter fully determines the probability mass function, including its mean and variance. Let’s look at some probability mass functions in the family of uniform parametric models: 7.8 Binomial experiment When we are interested in predicting absolute frequencies when we know the parameter \\(p\\) of particular Bernoulli trial, we repeat the Bernoulli trial \\(n\\) times and count how many times we obtained \\(A\\) using the absolute frequency of \\(A\\): \\(N_A\\). define a random variable \\(X=N_A\\) taking values \\(x \\in {0,1,...n}\\) When we repeat \\(n\\) times a Bernoulli trial, we obtain one value for \\(n_A\\). If we perform other \\(n\\) Bernoulli trials then \\(n_A\\) changes its value. Therefore, \\(X=N_A\\) is a random variable and \\(x=n_A\\) is its observation. Examples (Some binomial experiments): Writing down the sex of \\(n=10\\) patients who go into an emergency room of a hospital. What is the probability that \\(X=9\\) patients are men when \\(p=0.8\\)? Trying \\(n=5\\) times to hit a target (\\(A:success\\) and \\(B:failure\\)). What is the probability that I hit the target \\(X=5\\) times when I usually hit it \\(25\\%\\) of the times (\\(p=0.25\\))? Transmitting \\(n=100\\) pixels correctly (\\(A:yes\\) and \\(B:no\\)). What is the probability that \\(X=2\\) pixels are errors, when the probability of error is \\(p=0.1\\)? 7.9 Binomial probability function Let us suppose that we know the real value of the parameter of the Bernoulli trial \\(p\\). When we repeat a Bernoulli trial and stop at \\(n\\), is the value \\(x\\) that we obtain common or rare? what is its probability mass function \\(P(X=x)=f(x)\\)? Example (transmission of pixels): What is the probability of observing \\(X=x\\) errors when transmitting \\(n=4\\) pixels, if the probability of an error is \\(p\\)? Let us consider that A random variable of the transmission experiment is the vector \\[(K_1, K_2, K_3, K_4)\\] where one observation may be \\((K_1=0, K_2=1, K_3=0, K_4=1)\\) or \\((0, 1, 0, 1)\\). Each \\[K_i \\rightarrow Bernoulli(p)\\] \\(k_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\) \\(X=N_A\\) can be computed as the sum \\[X=\\sum_{i=1}^4 K_i\\] \\(x\\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}\\). For example \\(X=2\\) for the outcome \\((0, 1, 0, 1)\\). Now let’s see the probabilities of some error events and then we will generalize them. What is the probability of observing \\(4\\) errors? The probability of observing \\(4\\) errors is the probability of observing an error in the \\(1^{st}\\) and \\(2^{nd}\\) and \\(3^{rd}\\) and \\(4^{th}\\) pixel: \\[P(X=4)=P(1,1,1,1)=p*p*p*p=p^4\\] because \\(K_i\\) are independent. What is the probability of observing \\(0\\) errors? The probability of \\(0\\) errors is the joint probability of observing no error in any transmission: \\[P(X=0)=P(0,0,0,0)=(1-p)(1-p)(1-p)(1-p)=(1-p)^4\\] What is the probability of observing \\(3\\) errors? The probability of \\(3\\) errors is the addition of probability of observing \\(3\\) errors in different events: \\[P(X=3)=P(0,1,1,1)+P(1,0,1,1)+P(1,1,0,1)+P(1,1,1,0)=4p^3(1-p)^1\\] because all off these events are mutually exclusive. Therefore the probability of \\(x\\) errors is \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases} 1*p^0(1-p)^4,&amp; x=0 \\\\ 4*p^1(1-p)^3,&amp; x=1 \\\\ 6*p^2(1-p)^2,&amp; x=2 \\\\ 4*p^3(1-p)^1,&amp; x=3 \\\\ 1*p^4(1-p)^0,&amp; x=4 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] or more shortly \\[f(x)=\\binom 4 x p^x(1-p)^{4-x}\\] for \\(x=0,1,2,3,4\\) where \\(\\binom 4 x\\) is the number of possible outcomes (transmissions of \\(4\\) pixels) with \\(x\\) errors. Definition: The binomial probability function is the probability mass function of observing \\(x\\) outcomes of type \\(A\\) in \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli trials, where \\(A\\) has the same probability \\(p\\) in each trial. The function is given by \\(f(x)=\\binom n x p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\\), \\(x=0,1,...n\\) \\(\\binom n x= \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}\\) is called the binomial coefficient and gives the number of ways one can obtain \\(x\\) events of type \\(A\\) in a set of \\(n\\). When a variable \\(X\\) has a binomial probability function we say it distributes binomially and write \\[X\\rightarrow Bin(n,p)\\] where \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) are parameters. Let’s look at some probability mass functions in the family of binomial parametric models: Properties: If a random variable \\(X\\rightarrow Bin(n,p)\\) then its mean is \\[E(X)=np\\] its variance is \\[V(X)=np(1-p)\\] These properties can be demonstrated by the fact that \\(X\\) is the sum of \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli variables. Therefore, \\(E(X)=E(\\sum_{i=1}^n K_i)=np\\) and \\(V(X)=V(\\sum_{i=1}^n K_i)=n(1-p)p\\) Example (transmission of pixels): The expected value for the number of errors in the transmission of \\(4\\) pixels is \\(np=4*0.1=0.4\\) when the probability of an error is \\(0.1\\). The variance is \\(n(1-p)p=0.36\\) What is the probability of observing \\(4\\) errors? Since we are repeating a Bernoulli trial \\(n=4\\) times and counting the number of events of type \\(A\\) (errors), when \\(P(A)=p=0.1\\) then \\[X \\rightarrow Bin(n=4, p=0.1)\\] That is \\[f(x)=\\binom 4 x 0.1^x(1-0.1)^{4-x}\\] \\(P(X=4)=f(4)=\\binom 4 4 0.1^4 0.9^{0}=0.1^4=10^{-4}\\) In R dbinom(4,4,0.1) What is the probability of observing \\(2\\) errors? \\(P(X=2)=\\binom 4 2 0.1^2 0.9^2=0.0486\\) In R dbinom(2,4,0.1) Example (opinion polls): What is the probability of observing at most \\(8\\) voters of the ruling party in an election poll of size \\(10\\), if the probability of a positive vote for the party is \\(0.9\\) For this case \\[X \\rightarrow Bin(n=10, p=0.9)\\] That is \\[f(x)=\\binom {10} x 0.9^x(0.1)^{4-x}\\] We want to compute: \\(P(X\\le 8)=F(8)= \\sum_{i=1..8} f(x_i)=0.2639011\\) in R pbinom(8,10, 0.9) 7.10 Negative binomial probability function Now let us imagine that we are interested in counting the well-transmitted pixels before a given number of errors occur. Say we can tolerate \\(r\\) errors in transmission. Our random experiment is now: Repeat Bernoulli trials until we observe the outcome \\(A\\) appears \\(r\\) times. The outcome of the experiment is the number of events \\(n_B=y\\) We are interested in finding the probability of observing a particular number of events \\(B\\), \\(P(Y=y)\\), where \\(Y=N_B\\) is the random variable. Example (transmission of pixels): What is the probability of observing \\(y\\) well-transmitted (\\(B\\)) pixels before \\(r\\) errors (\\(A\\))? Let’s first find the probability of one particular transmission event with \\(y\\) number of correct pixels (\\(B\\)) and \\(r\\) number of errors (\\(A\\)). \\[(0,0,1,., 0,1,...0,1)\\] where we consider that there are \\(y\\) zeros and \\(r\\) ones. Therefore, we observe \\(y\\) correct pixels in a total of \\(y + r\\) pixels. The probability of this event is: \\[P(0,0,1,., 0,1,...0,1)=p^r(1-p)^y\\] Remember that \\(p\\) is the probability of error (\\(A\\)). How many transmissions events can have \\(y\\) correct pixels (0’s) before \\(r\\) errors (1’s)? Note that The last bit is fixed (marks the end of transmission) The total number of ways in which \\(y\\) number of zeros can be allocated in \\(y + r-1\\) pixels (the last pixel is fixed with value 1) is: \\(\\binom {y + r-1} y\\) Therefore, the probability of observing \\(y\\) 1’s before \\(r\\) 0’s (each 1 with probability \\(p\\)) is \\[P(Y=y)=f(y)=\\binom {y+r-1} y p^r(1-p)^y\\] for \\(y=0,1,...\\) We then say that \\(Y\\) follows a negative binomial distribution and we write \\[Y\\rightarrow NB(r,p)\\] where \\(r\\) and \\(p\\) are parameters representing the tolerance and the probability of a single error (event \\(A\\)). Properties: A random variable \\(Y\\rightarrow NB(r,p)\\) has mean \\[E(Y)= r\\frac{1-p}{p}\\] and variance \\[V(Y)= r\\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\] Let’s look at some probability mass functions in the family of negative binomial parametric models: Example (website) A website has three servers. One server operates at a time and only when a request fails another server is used. If the probability of failure for a request is known to be \\(p=0.0005\\) then what is the expected number of successful requests before the three computers fail? Since we are repeating a Bernoulli trial until \\(r=3\\) events of type \\(A\\) (failure) are observed (each with \\(P(A)=p=0.0005\\)) and are counting the number of events of type \\(B\\) (successful requests) then \\[Y \\rightarrow NB(r=3, p=0.0005)\\] Therefore, the expected number of requests before the system fails is: \\(E(Y)=r\\frac{1-p}{p}=3\\frac{1-0.0005}{0.0005}=5997\\) Note that there are actually \\(6000\\) trials. What is the probability of dealing with at most \\(5\\) successful requests before the system fails? We therefore want to compute the probability distribution at \\(5\\): \\(F(5)=P(Y\\leq 5)=\\Sigma_{y=0}^5 f(y)\\) \\(=\\sum_{y=0}^5\\binom {y+2} y 0.0005^r0.9995^y\\) \\(=\\binom {2} 0 0.0005^3 0.9995^0 +\\binom {3} 1 0.0005^3 0.9995^1\\) \\(+\\binom {4} 2 0.0005^3 0.9995^2 +\\binom {5} 3 0.0005^3 0.9995^3\\) \\(+\\binom {6} 4 0.0005^3 0.9995^4 +\\binom {7} 5 0.0005^3 0.9995^5\\) \\(= 6.9\\times 10^{-9}\\) In R this is computed with pnbinom(5,3,0.0005) Examples What is the probability of observing \\(10\\) correct pixels before \\(2\\) errors, if the probability of an error is \\(0.1\\)? \\(f(10; r=2, p=0.1)=0.03835463\\) in R dnbinom(10, 2, 0.1) What is the probability that \\(2\\) girls enter the class before \\(4\\) boys if the probability that a girl enters is \\(0.5\\)? \\(f(2; r=4, p=0.5)=0.15625\\) in R dnbinom(2, 4, 0.5) 7.11 Geometric distribution We call geometric distribution to the negative binomial distribution with \\(r=1\\) The probability of observing \\(B\\) events before observing the first event of type \\(A\\) is \\[P(Y=y)=f(y)= p(1-p)^y\\] \\[Y\\rightarrow Geom(p)\\] which has mean \\[E(Y)= \\frac{1-p}{p}\\] and variance \\[V(Y)= \\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\] 7.12 Hypergeometric model The hypergeometric model arises when we want to count the number of events of type \\(A\\) that are drawn from a finite population. The general model is to consider \\(N\\) total balls in a urn. Mark \\(K\\) with label \\(A\\) and \\(N-K\\) with label \\(B\\). Take out \\(n\\) balls one by one with no replacement in the urn, and then count how many \\(A\\)’s you obtained. The Binomial model can be derived from the Hypergeometric model when we consider that either \\(N\\) is infinite, or that every time we draw a ball we replace it back in the urn. Example (chickenpox): A school of \\(N=600\\) children has an epidemic of chickenpox. We tested \\(n=200\\) children and observed that \\(x=17\\) were positive. If we knew that a total of \\(K=64\\) were really infected in the school, what is the probability of our observation? Definition: The probability of obtaining \\(x\\) cases (type \\(A\\)) in a sample of \\(n\\) drawn from a population of \\(N\\) where \\(K\\) are cases (type \\(A\\)). \\(P(X=x)=P(one\\,sample) \\times (Number\\, of\\, ways\\, of\\, obtaining\\, x)\\) \\[=\\frac{1}{\\binom N n}\\binom K x \\binom {N-K} {n-x}\\] where \\(k \\in \\{\\max(0, n+K-N), ... \\min(K, n) \\}\\) We then say that \\(X\\) follows a hypergeometric distribution and write \\[X \\rightarrow Hypergeometric(N,K,n)\\] The hypergeometric model has three parameters. Properties: If \\(X \\rightarrow Hypergeometric(N,K,n)\\) then it has mean \\[E(X) = n \\frac{K}{N} = np\\] and variance \\[V(X) = np(1-p)\\frac{N-n}{N-1}\\] when \\(p=\\frac{K}{N}\\) is the proportion of hepatitis C in a population of size \\(N\\). Note that when \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) then we recover the binomial properties. Let’s look at some probability mass functions in the family of hypergeometric parametric models: Example (chickenpox): what is the probability of infections less or equal than \\(17\\) in a sample of \\(200\\), drawn from a population of \\(600\\) where \\(64\\) are infected? The probability that we need to compute is \\(P(X \\leq 17)=F(17)\\) where \\(X \\rightarrow Hypergeometric(N=600,K=64,n=200)\\) in R phyper(17, 64, 600-64, 200)=0.140565 The solution is the addition of the blue needles in the plot. 7.13 Questions 1) What is the expected value and the variance of the number of failures in \\(100\\) prototypes, when the probability of a failure is \\(0.25\\) \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(0.25\\), \\(0.1875\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(25\\), \\(0.1875\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(0.25\\), \\(18.75\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(25\\), \\(18.75\\) 2) The number of available tables at lunch time in a restaurant is better described by which probability model \\(\\qquad\\)a: Binomial; \\(\\qquad\\)b: Uniform; \\(\\qquad\\)c: Negative Binomial; \\(\\qquad\\)d: Hypergeometric 3) The expected value of a Binomial distribution is not \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(n\\) times the expected value of a Bernoulli; \\(\\qquad\\)b: the expected value of a Hypergeometric, when the population is very big; \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(np\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: the limit of the relative frequency when the number of repetitions is large 4) Opinion polls for the USA 2022 election give a probability of \\(0.55\\) that a voter favors the republican party.

At each stage, we introduced some novel concept: Uniform: Classical interpretation of probability \\(\\downarrow\\) Bernoulli: Introduction of a parameter \\(p\\) (family of models) \\(\\downarrow\\) Binomial: Introductio of the Repetition of a random experiment (\\(n\\)-times Bernoulli trials) \\(\\downarrow\\) Poisson: Repetition of random experiment within a continuous interval, having no control on when/where the Bernoulli trial occurs. The last stage is the Poisson process that describes a the repetition of a random experiment with additional randomness at the time of repetition. 8.3 Poissson experiment Imagine that we are observing events that depend on time or distance intervals. for example: cars arriving at a traffic light getting messages on your mobile phone impurities occurring at random in a copper wire Suppose that the events are outcomes of independent Bernoulli trials each appearing randomly on a continuous interval, and we want to count them. What is the probability of observing \\(X\\) events in an interval’s unit (time or distance)? Example (Impurities in a wire): Imagine that some impurities deposit randomly along a copper wire. You want to count the number of impurities in one given centimeter of the wire (\\(X\\)). Consider that you know that on average there are \\(10\\) impurities per centimeter \\(\\lambda=10/cm\\). What is the probability of observing \\(X=5\\) impurities in one specimen of one centimeter in particular? 8.4 Poisson probability mass function To calculate the probability mass function \\(f(x)=P(X=x)\\) of the previous example we divide the centimeter into micrometers (\\(0.0001cm\\)). Micrometers are small enough so either there is or there is not an impurity in each micrometer each micrometer can be then be considered a Bernoulli trial From the Binomial to the Poisson probability function The probability of observing \\(X\\) impurities in \\(n=10,000\\mu\\) (1cm) approximately follows a binomial distribution \\[f(x) \\sim \\binom n x p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\\] where \\(p\\) is the probability of finding an impurity in a micrometer. Since the expected value of a Binomial variable is: \\(E(X)=np\\). This is the average number of impurities per 1cm or \\(\\lambda=np\\). Therefore, substitute \\(p=\\lambda/n\\) \\[f(x) \\sim \\binom n x \\big(\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\big)^x(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n})^{n-x}\\] Since, there could still be two impurities in a micrometer, we need to increase the partition of the wire and \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Then in the limit: \\[f(x)= \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!}\\] Where \\(\\lambda\\) is constant because it is the density of impurities per centimeter, a physical property of the system. \\(\\lambda\\) is therefore the parameter of the probability model. Derivation details: For \\(f(x) \\sim \\binom n x \\big(\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\big)^x(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n})^{n-x}\\) in the limit (\\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\)) \\(\\frac{1}{n^x}\\binom n x =\\frac{1}{n^x}\\frac{n!}{x! (n-x)!}=\\frac{(n-x)!(n-x+1)...(n-1)n}{n^x x! (n-x)!}=\\frac{n(n-1)..(n-x+1)}{n^x x!} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{x!}\\) \\((1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n})^{n} \\rightarrow e^{-\\lambda}\\) (definition of exponential) \\((1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n})^{-x} \\rightarrow 1\\) Putting everything together then: \\(f(x)= \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!}\\) Definition Given an interval in the real numbers counts occur at random in the interval the average number of counts on the interval is known (\\(\\lambda\\)) if one can find a small regular partition of the interval such that each of them can be considered Bernoulli trials. Then the random variable \\(X\\) that counts events across the interval is a Poisson variable with probability mass function \\[f(x)= \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!}, \\lambda&gt;0\\] Properties: When \\(X \\rightarrow Poiss(\\lambda)\\) it has mean \\[E(X)= \\lambda\\] and variance \\[V(X)= \\lambda\\] Examples What is the probability of receiving 4 emails in an hour, when the average number of emails in an hour is \\(1\\)? We have that the variable is Poisson: \\(X \\rightarrow Poiss(\\lambda)\\) with \\(\\lambda=1\\) and its probability mass function is: \\[f(x)= \\frac{e^{-1}1^x}{x!}\\] Therefore the probability that the variable takes value 4 is \\(P(X=4)\\): \\(f(4; \\lambda=1)= \\frac{e^{-1}1^4}{4!}=0.01532831\\) in R dpois(4,1) What is the probability of receiving 4 emails in three hours, when the average number of emails in an hour is \\(1\\)? The unit in which we do the counts has changed from 1 hour to 2 hours, so we have to re-scale \\(\\lambda\\). If before the average number of emails in one hour was \\(\\lambda=1\\), the average number of emails in three hours is now 3: \\(\\lambda_{3h}=3\\lambda_{1h}=3*1=3\\) We have that the variable is Poisson: \\(X \\rightarrow Poiss(\\lambda_{3h})\\) with \\(\\lambda_{3h}=3\\) and its probability mass function is: \\[f(x)= \\frac{e^{-3}3^x}{x!}\\] Therefore the probability that the variable takes value 4 is \\(P(X=4)\\): \\(f(4; \\lambda=3)= \\frac{e^{-3}3^4}{4!}=0.1680314\\) in R dpois(4,3) What is the probability of counting at least \\(10\\) cars arriving at a toll booth in one minute, when the average number of cars arriving at a toll booth in one minute is \\(5\\); We have that the variable is Poisson: \\(X \\rightarrow Poiss(\\lambda)\\) with \\(\\lambda=5\\) and its probability mass function is: \\[f(x)= \\frac{e^{-5}5^x}{x!}\\] \\(P(X\\geq 10)=1-P(X &lt; 10)=1-P(X \\leq 9)=1-F(9; \\lambda=5)=1-\\sum_{x=0, ...10}f(x; \\lambda=5)=0.03182806\\) in R 1-ppois(9,5) Let’s look at some probability mass functions in the family of parametric Poisson models: 8.5 Continuous probability models Continuous probability models are probability density functions \\(f(x)\\) of a continuous random variables that we believe describe real random experiments. Probability density function \\(f(x)\\) is positive \\[f(x) \\geq 0\\] allows us to compute probabilities using the area under the curve: \\[P(a\\leq X \\leq b)=\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx\\] is such that the probability of anything is \\(1\\): \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 1\\] 8.6 Exponential process Let’s go back to a Poisson process defined by probability \\[f(k)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!}, \\lambda&gt;0\\] for the number of events (\\(k\\)) in an interval. Let us now consider that we are interested in the duration/time we should wait for the first count to occur. We can ask about the probability that the first event occurs after duration/time \\(X\\). Therefore, since \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable, we look for its probaility density function \\(f(x)\\). 8.7 Exponential probability density The probability of \\(0\\) counts if an interval has unit \\(x\\) is \\[f(0|x)=\\frac{e^{-x\\lambda}x\\lambda^0}{0!}\\] or \\[f(0|x)=e^{-x\\lambda}\\] We can treat this as the conditional probability of \\(0\\) events in a distance \\(x\\): \\(f(K=0|X=x)\\) and apply the Bayes theorem to reverse it: \\[f(x|0)=C f(0|x)=C e^{-x\\lambda}\\] So we can calculate the probability of observing a distance a distance \\(x\\) with \\(0\\) counts. This is the distance between any two events or the distance until the first event. Definition In a Poisson process with parameter \\(\\lambda\\) the probability of waiting a distance/time \\(X\\) between two counts is given by the probability density \\[f(x)= C e^{-x\\lambda}\\] \\(C\\) is a constant that ensures: \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx =1\\) by integration \\(C=\\lambda\\) Therefore: \\[f(x)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}, x\\geq 0\\] \\(\\lambda\\) is the paramenter of the model also known as a decay rate. Properties: When \\(X \\rightarrow Exp(\\lambda)\\) then It has mean \\[E(X)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\] and variance \\[V(Y)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\] Let’s look at a couple of the probability densities in the exponential family 8.8 Exponential Distribution Consider the following questions: In a Poisson process ¿What is the probability of observing an interval smaller than size \\(a\\) until the first count? Remember that this probability \\(F(a)=P(X \\leq a)\\) is the probability density \\[F(a)=\\lambda \\int_\\infty^a e^{-x\\lambda}dx=1-e^{-a\\lambda}\\] 2) In a Poisson process ¿What is the probability of observing an interval larger than size \\(a\\) until the first event? \\[P(X &gt; a)=1- P(X \\leq a)= 1- F(a) = e^{-a\\lambda}\\] Let’s look at a couple of exponential distributions from the exponential family The median \\(x_m\\) is such that \\(F(x_m)=0.5\\). That is \\(x_m=\\frac{\\log(2)}{\\lambda}\\) Examples What is the probability that we have to wait for a bus for more than \\(1\\) hour when on average there are two buses per hour? \\[P(X &gt; 1)=1-P(X \\le 1) = 1-F(1,\\lambda=2)=0.1353353\\] in R 1-pexp(1,2) What is the probability of having to wait less than \\(2\\) seconds to detect one particle when the radioactive decay rate is \\(2\\) particles each second; \\(F(2,\\lambda=2)\\) \\[P(X \\le 2)=F(2,\\lambda=2)=0.9816844\\] in R pexp(2,2) 8.9 Questions 1) During WWII in London, the expected number of bombs that hit an area of \\(3km^2\\) was \\(0.92\\).

We will discuss its origin and its main properties. 9.2 History In 1801 Gauss analyzed data obtained for the position of the Ceres, a large asteroid between Mars and Jupiter. At the time people suspected it was a new planet, as it moved day to day against the fixed stars. In January, it could be seen at the horizon just before dawn. However, as days passed Ceres will rise latter and latter until it could not longer be seen because of the Sun rise. Gauss understood that the measurements for the position of Ceres had errors. He was therefore interested in finding how the observations were distributed so he could find the most likely orbit. With the orbit, we could derive the mass of the object and then decide whether it was a planet or a big asteroid. Data was available only for the month of January. After which Ceres would disappear. He wanted to predict where astronomers should point their telescopes to find it six months after at dusk, once it had passed behind the Sun. Gauss had to account for the errors in the position of ceres at a given day due to measurement Gauss supposed that small errors were more likely than large errors the error at a distance \\(-\\epsilon\\) from the value at the position of Ceres was equally likely as a distance \\(\\epsilon\\) the most likely (that we believe) of Ceres at any given time in the sky was the average of multiple altitude measurements at that latitude. That was enough to show that the deviations of the observations \\(y\\) from the orbit satisfied the equation \\[\\frac{df(y)}{dy}=-Cyf(y)\\] with \\(C\\) a positive constant. The solution of this differential equation is: \\[f(y)=\\frac{\\sqrt{C}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{Cy^2}{2}}\\] *The evolution of the normal distribution, Saul Stahl, Mathemetics Magazine, 2006. 9.3 normal density Gaussian probability density gives the distribution of measurement errors from the actual but unknown position of Ceres in the sky. Let’s make a couple of changes to the function. 1- Let’s write the error density from the horizon using the random variable \\(X\\), that is, \\(y=x-\\mu\\). \\(\\mu\\) is the actual but unknown position of Ceres from the horizon. After a change of variable we find the probability density function: \\[f(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{C}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-C(x-\\mu)^2}\\] Let’s rename the variable \\(C\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\) So, we arrive at the following definition. 9.4 Definition A random variable \\(X\\) defined on the real numbers has a density Normal if it takes the form \\[f(x; \\mu, \\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}, x \\in {\\mathbb R}\\] The variable has mean \\[E(X) = \\mu\\] which for Gauss represented the actual position of Ceres. and variance \\[V(X) = \\sigma^2\\] which represented the dispersion of the error in the observations, which depends on the quality of the telescope. \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the two parameters that completely describe the normal density function and their interpretation depends on the random experiment. When \\(X\\) follows a Normal density, that is, it is normally distributed, we write \\[X\\rightarrow N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\] Let’s look at some probability densities in the normal parametric model 9.5 Probability distribution The probability distribution of the Normal density: \\[F_{normal}(a)=P(Z \\leq a)\\] is the error function defined by the area under the curve from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(a\\) \\[F_{normal}(a)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{a}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} dx\\] The function is found in most computer programs, and it does not have a closed form of known functions. Example (women’s height) What is the probability that a woman in the population is at most \\(150cm\\) tall if women have a mean height of \\(165cm\\) with standard deviation of \\(8cm\\)? \\(P(X\\le 150)=F(150, \\mu=165, \\sigma=8)=0.03039636\\) in R pnorm(150, 165, 8) What is the probability that a woman’s height in the population is between \\(165cm\\) and \\(170cm\\)? \\(P(165 \\le X \\le 170)=F(170, \\mu=165, \\sigma=8)-F(165, \\mu=165, \\sigma=8)=0.2340145\\) in R pnorm(170, 165, 8)-pnorm(165, 165, 8) Let’s look at the probability distribution function What is the first quartile for height in women? The first quartile is defined as: \\(F(x_{0.25}, \\mu=165, \\sigma=8)=0.25\\) or \\(x_{0.25}=F^{-1}(0.25, µ=165, \\sigma=8)=159.6041\\) in R qnorm(0.25, 165, 8) Properties of the Normal distribution the mean \\(\\mu\\) is also the median as it splits the measurements in two \\(x\\) values that fall farther than 2\\(\\sigma\\) are considered rare \\(5\\%\\) \\(x\\) values that fall farther than 3\\(\\sigma\\) are considered extremely rare \\(0.2\\%\\) Example (women’s height) We can define the limits of common observations for the distribution of women’s height in the population. at a distance of one standard deviation from the mean, we find \\(68\\%\\) of the population \\[P(165-8 \\leq X \\leq 165+8)=P(157 \\leq X \\leq 173)=F(173)-F(157)=0.68\\] at a distance of two standard deviations from the mean, we find \\(95\\%\\) of the population \\[P(165-2 \\times 8 \\leq X \\leq 165+2\\times 8)=F(181)-F(149)=0.95\\] at a distance of three standard deviations from the mean, we find \\(99.7\\%\\) of the population \\[P(165-3 \\times 8 \\leq X \\leq 165+3\\times 8)=F(189)-F(141)=0.997\\] 9.6 Standard normal density The standard normal density is the particular density from the normal family \\[f(x; \\mu, \\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}, x \\in {\\mathbb R}\\] It is therefore the density with mean \\[E (X)= \\mu = 0\\] and variance \\[V (X)= \\sigma^2 =1\\] When a random variable follows a normal probability density, we say that it distributes normally and write \\[X \\rightarrow N(0,1)\\] 9.7 Standard distribution The probability distribution of the standard density: \\[\\phi(a)=F_{N(0,1)}(a)=P(Z \\leq a)\\] is the error function defined by \\[\\phi(a)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{a} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{z^2}{2}} dz\\] Because the standard distribution is special and will appear often then we use the letter \\(\\phi\\) for it. You can find it in most computer programs. in R is pnorm(x) with the default parameters, 0 and 1. We usually define the limits of the most common observations for the standard variable The interquartile range \\[P(-0.67 \\leq X \\leq 0.67)=0.50\\] in R: c(qnorm(0.25), qnorm(0.75)) \\(95\\%\\) range \\[P(-1.96 \\leq X \\leq 1.96)=0.95\\] in R: c(qnorm(0.025), qnorm(0.975)) \\(99\\%\\) range \\[P(-2.58 \\leq X \\leq 2.58)=0.99\\] in R: c(qnorm(0.005), qnorm(0.995)) 9.8 Standardization All normal variables can be standardized. This means that if \\(X \\rightarrow N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), then we can transform the variable to a standardized variable \\[Z=\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\] which will have density: \\[f(z)=\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{z^2}{2}} \\] Therefore, for any \\(X \\rightarrow N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) \\[Z=\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\rightarrow N(0, 1) \\] You can demonstrate this by replacing \\(x=\\sigma z+\\mu\\) and \\(dx=\\sigma dz\\) in the probability expression we have \\(P(x\\leq X \\leq x +dx)=P(z\\leq Z \\leq z +dz)\\) \\[=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}dx\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{z^2}{2}} dz\\] The probability of any normal variable \\(X\\rightarrow N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) can be computed using the standard distribution \\(F(a)=P(X&lt;a)=P(\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}&lt;\\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma})\\) \\[=P(Z &lt; \\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma})= \\phi \\big(\\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\big)\\] For computing \\(P(a\\leq X \\leq b)\\), we can use the property of the probability distributions \\(F(b)-F(a)=P(X\\leq b)-P(X\\leq a)\\) \\[=\\phi \\big(\\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\big)-\\phi \\big(\\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\big)\\] 9.9 Summary of probability models Model X range of x f(x) E(X) V(X) Uniform integer or real number \\([a, b]\\) \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) \\(\\frac{b+a}{2}\\) \\(\\frac{(b-a+1)^2-1}{12}\\) Bernoulli event A 0,1 \\((1-p)^{1-x}p^x\\) \\(p\\) \\(p(1-p)\\) Binomial # of A events in \\(n\\) repetitions of Bernoulli trials 0,1,… \\(\\binom n x (1-p)^{n-x}p^x\\) \\(np\\) \\(np(1-p)\\) Negative Binomial for events # of B events in Bernoulli repetitions before \\(r\\) As are observed 0,1,.. \\(\\binom {x+r-1} x (1-p)^xp^r\\) \\(\\frac{r(1-p)}{p}\\) \\(\\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}\\) Hypergeometric # A events in a sample \\(n\\) from population \\(N\\) with \\(K\\) As \\(\\max(0, n+K-N)\\), … \\(\\min(K, n)\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\binom N n}\\binom K x \\binom {N-K} {n-x}\\) \\(n*\\frac{N}{K}\\) \\(n \\frac{N}{K} (1-\\frac{N}{K})\\frac{N-n}{N-1}\\) Poisson # of events A in an interval 0,1, .. \\(\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^x}{x!}\\) \\(\\lambda\\) \\(\\lambda\\) Exponential Interval between two events A \\([0,\\infty)\\) \\(\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\) Normal measurement with symmetric errors whose most likely value is the average \\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\) \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\) \\(\\mu\\) \\(\\sigma^2\\) 9.10 R functions of probability models Model R Uniform (continuous) dunif(x, a, b) Binomial dbinom(x,n,p) Negative Binomial for events dnbinom(x,r,p) Hypergeometric dhyper(x, K, N-K, n) Poisson dpois(x, lambda) Exponential dexp(x, lambda) Normal dnorm(x, mu, sigma) 9.11 Questions 1) It is not true that for a normally distributed variable \\(\\qquad\\)a: its mean and median are the same; \\(\\qquad\\)b: the standard probability distribution can be used to compute its probabilities; \\(\\qquad\\)c: its interquartile range is twice its standard deviation; \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(5\\%\\) of its observations are a distance greater than twice its standard deviation 2) For a normal standard variable \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(50\\%\\) of its observations are between \\((-0.67,0.67)\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(2\\%\\) of its observations are lower than \\(-2.58\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(5\\%\\) of its observations are greater than \\(1.96\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(25\\%\\) of its observations are between \\((-1.96,-0.67)\\) 3) if we know that \\(\\phi(-0.8416212)=0.2\\) then what is \\(\\phi(0.8416212)\\) \\(\\qquad\\)a: \\(0.1\\); \\(\\qquad\\)b: \\(0.2\\); \\(\\qquad\\)c: \\(0.8\\); \\(\\qquad\\)d: \\(0.9\\) 4) the third quartile of a normal variable with mean \\(10\\) and standard deviation \\(2\\) is \\(\\qquad\\)a: qnorm(1/3, 10, 2)=9.138545; \\(\\qquad\\)b: qnorm(1-0.75, 10, 2)=8.65102 ; \\(\\qquad\\)c: qnorm(1-1/3, 10, 2)=10.86145 ; \\(\\qquad\\)d: qnorm(0.75, 10, 2)= 11.34898 5) probability that a normal variable with mean \\(10\\) and standard deviation \\(2\\) is in \\((-\\infty,10)\\) is \\(\\qquad\\)a: 0.25; \\(\\qquad\\)b: 0.5; \\(\\qquad\\)c: 0.75; \\(\\qquad\\)d: 1: 9.12 Exercises 9.12.0.1 Exercise 1 Find the area under the standard normal curve in the following cases: Between \\(z=0.81\\) and \\(z=1.94\\) (R:0.182) To the right of \\(z=-1.28\\) (R:0.899) To the right of \\(z=2.05\\) or to the left of \\(z=-1.44\\) (R:0.0951) 9.12.0.2 Exercise 2 What is the probability that a man’s height is at least \\(165\\)cm if the population mean is \\(175\\)cm y the standard deviation is \\(10\\)cm?
